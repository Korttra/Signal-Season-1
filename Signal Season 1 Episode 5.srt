00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,590
Detective!

5
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,390
You came because of this person?

6
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,670
Is he male?

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,630
Yes, the gender is male.

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,690
His height is about 185 centimeters.

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,580
By the state of his teeth, he was
in his mid-30s when he died.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,450
Where was he found?

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,790
He was find in Yasan on Highway 13.

12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,220
Are you certain it's Highway 13?

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,600
But you should know...
His shoulder is smooth.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,580
He doesn't have a metal plate
in his right shoulder.

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,110
I'm just curious.
Who exactly are you looking for?

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,980
You're famous for always being single.
It can't be an old boyfriend.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,250
Thanks for everything.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,530
What was that about?

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
She does that every time
we get skeletal remains.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,150
She's looking for someone in his 30s
with a metal plate in his shoulder.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,700
Who is he?

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,260
<i>I'm not sure. I'm not entirely certain.</i>

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,150
<i>It's someone she really wants to see</i>

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,880
<i>or someone she really wishes were dead.</i>

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,330
<i>It's one of the two.</i>

I'll make sure to catch him. I will.</i>

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,510
Do you promise?

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,040
I promise you.
I'll get him this week.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,630
How could you have entered an empty
house and brought nothing out?

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,030
Stop telling me this nonsense.

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,660
Hello, sir!

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,290
Hello, sir!

34
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,890
Reporting for duty.

35
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,440
Starting on September 1, 1995,
I, Officer Cha Soo Hyun

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,130
received orders to report for duty
at Seoul District's Task Force Squad.

37
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,660
So I am reporting for duty. Sir!

38
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,080
Well, I'm glad you're here.

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm not sure why
you applied to come here.

40
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,300
But the people here are not so scary.

41
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,870
You can relax a bit.
I hope we can work well together.

42
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,660
Yes.

43
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,200
Do you have a question?

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,920
Ah, am I allowed to ask questions?

45
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,010
Of course, of course.

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,650
I heard that I would need
to work overnight often.

47
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,400
Where is the night duty room for women?

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,980
Hey, get up. Get up!

49
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,520
Clean this up.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,850
Wake up.

51
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,140
Get up already, would you?
We have to empty this room.

52
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,060
We were told to empty this room.
Just wake up!

53
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,360
I won't empty the room!

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,820
What is this? Is this a bath house?

55
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,990
Why would we have separate rooms
for men's and women?

56
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,660
If we give that room to her,
where would we sleep?

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,010
Should we sleep on the streets?

58
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,630
I'll turn the third floor storage
into a night duty room.

59
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,990
You'll be all right until then.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,560
A storage? Did you say storage?

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,390
Why do we have to give that to her
and sleep in the storage?

62
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,890
She's the first female officer
on our squad.

63
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
She's the mascot of
the Police Task Force Squad.

64
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,150
Mascot, yeah right!

65
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,640
Anyway, just be quiet
and be good to her.

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,170
She is a woman after all...
Look at the state of you.

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
You know better than anyone else.

68
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,000
I was on a stakeout for three whole days.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,020
I finally washed my clothes today
and was planning on sleeping.

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,560
And now you kick me out.

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,110
I think this is just wrong!

72
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,880
Please reconsider this.

73
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,920
Yeah, this isn't right.

74
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,430
No, it isn't.

75
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,710
It's because I was holding onto this.

76
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,600
- Officer Cha Soo Hyun.
- Yes.

77
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,200
Do you know what it means
to wear that uniform?

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,430
What?

79
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,320
Once you put on that uniform,
there is no such thing as a man or woman.

80
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,650
Are you going to go after criminals
caring whether they are men or women?

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,910
No, I...

82
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,810
Also, if you act like a girl one
more time and become a nuisance...

83
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,690
You're dead meat, seriously.

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,110
You got it?

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,850
Yes.

86
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,630
Get out.

87
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,250
Pink, pink, pink...

88
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,380
I need to sleep.

89
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,080
- Hey.
- Yes?

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
Turn off the lights.

91
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,890
Okay.

92
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,300
What are you doing?

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,840
Yes, I'll be going now.

94
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,890
Then where should I go?

95
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
- Get out.
- Okay.

Yes, of course.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,830
Every year, he visits Won Kyung's
grave on the anniversary of her death.

101
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,700
He said he'd continue
being a police officer.

102
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,770
I had worried about him,
but he looked bright.

103
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,650
And he looked healthy.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,030
Are you still in touch with him?

105
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,480
- Have you met with him since?
- No.

106
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm not sure when it was,
but he stopped contacting me.

107
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,490
He stopped visiting Won Kyung as well.

108
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,300
Was that around the year 2000,
by any chance?

<i>[Employee Discharged]</i>

112
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,390
I need to talk to you.

113
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,900
You were in the Jinyang Precinct in 2000
during the Kim Yoon Jung abduction.

114
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm looking for
a violent crimes detective

115
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,640
that worked in that precinct.

116
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,770
Detective Lee Jae Han.

117
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,540
He did work in Violent Crimes
with you, right?

118
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,790
Why are you looking for
Detective Lee Jae Han?

119
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,000
It's for personal reasons.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,650
He was at Jinyang until the year 2000.

121
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,540
Then his file says that
he was discharged in 2001.

122
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,820
Why was he discharged?

123
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,440
Do you know what the criteria is
for an officer to get discharged?

124
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,670
Lack of mental capacity and judgment,
not taking responsibility.

125
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,220
Personality disorder, mental disorder,
excess debt, and lack of morals.

126
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,650
There's another one.

127
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
When it becomes impossible
for one to perform his duties.

128
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,790
Missing.

129

Detective Lee Jae Han?

131
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,200
But why would he be missing?

132
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,210
How did he go missing?

133
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,310
Who was in charge of the case
in Violent Crimes?

134
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,090
Are the investigation files still around?

135
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,440
Violent Crimes didn't
conduct the investigation.

136
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,460
Internal Affairs was in charge of it.

137
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,670
Internal Affairs?

138
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,660
- These are files you asked for.
- Thank you.

No one has noticed it for fifteen years.

153
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,140
But I am concerned about one thing.

154
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,510
How does Park Hae Young
even know Lee Jae Han?

155
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,710
What?

156
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,030
Lee Jae Han went missing in 2000.

157
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,440
Park Hae Young was just
a ten-year-old a kid.

158
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,580
There was no way they would
have known each other.

159
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,310
I looked into Park Hae Young's
family and close friends.

160
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,680
Nothing links him to Lee Jae Han.

A link!

162
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,060
Whatever is going on,
just watch him closely.

163
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,380
No one must ever find out why
Lee Jae Han really went missing.

164
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,210
The evidence from the Lee Jae Han case
were already disposed of.

165
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,170
Disposed of? When?

166
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,260
It wasn't all that long ago.
It was July 27.

167
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,530
Do you know what time
the disposal company came that day?

168
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,180
This is the CCTV from
the day you asked about.

169
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,240
It is Seo Hyung Joon,
the suspect of the Kim Yoon Jung case.

170
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,250
But... his thumb has been severed.

171
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,570
Someone has killed Seo Hyung Joon
and made it look like suicide.

172
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,090
<i>The last day that Yoon Soo Ah sent her
last blackmail letter was August 3, 2000.</i>

173
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,500
Seo Hyung Joon is not the kidnapper.

174
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,310
<i>That night, Detective Lee Jae Han
wasn't on the run.</i>

175
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,230
<i>He was at this place
sending me transmissions.</i>

176
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,840
The past can be changed.

177
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,910
<i>He gave his life to learn
who the real culprit was.</i>

178
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,190
Don't ever give up.

179
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,950
<i>The corruption, and the fact
that he went missing after...</i>

180
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,750
<i>He was framed for it all.</i>

181
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,340
<i>Detective Lee Jae Han was murdered.</i>

182
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,460
We will now hand out the special awards
for these important arrests.

183
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,360
Cha Soo Hyun of the Seoul Metropolitan
Cold Case Squad, come forward.

184
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,370
A Letter of Commendation

185
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,530
to Seoul Metropolitan Police's

186
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,000
highly effective cold case squad
led by Cha Soo Hyun.

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,560
They accomplished
the exceptional work of solving

188
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,350
the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders.

189
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,680
In doing so they've raised
the status of the police.

190
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Therefore, this commendation is awarded.

191
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,200
Signed on October 28, 2015 by
Superintendent Kang Shin Hwan.

192
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,540
Moving on, we will do a ceremony
for the Seoul's forensic team.

193
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,750
Team Leader, Lee Jang Hyuk.
Please come forward.

194
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,730
Is this really an awards ceremony?

195
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,960
It's supposed to be, but it feels like
we're being punished.

196
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,590
<i>Detective Lee Jae Han?</i>

197
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,980
To put it simply,
he was just crazy about money.

198
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,840
He would just suck
and suck it away from me.

199
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
He was like a vampire.

200
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,680
With a straw in me.

201
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,470
<i>A key witness, pictures, and money.</i>

202
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,820
<i>The frame job for Detective Lee Jae Han's
bribery charge is perfect.</i>

203
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,890
<i>Like a well-plotted play.</i>

204
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,120
<i>Who and why?</i>

205
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,180
<i>I don't know why anyone would
plant evidence and frame him.</i>

206
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,650
<i>But without someone within
the police organization</i>

207
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,420
<i>it's impossible to do a job like this.</i>

208
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,460
<i>A frame job within
the police organization.</i>

209
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,410
Next, we will move onto...

210
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,820
We got an award as soon as
we opened up shop!

211
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,950
Now we've got investigation funds
and vacation time.

212
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,120
We must really be the aces.

213
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,520
We solved a 15-year-old abduction case

214
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,080
and solved the Gyeonggi Nambu case
that had been cold for 26 years.

215
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,050
It wasn't us. It was Park Hae Young.

216
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,860
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

217
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,470
We solved the abduction case because
he found Seo Hyung Joon's body.

218
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,750
Now that you mention it, that's true.

219
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,520
Wasn't that just luck?

220
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,980
Seo Hyung Joon's body was found
in a manhole of a closed hospital.

221
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,380
That would be hard to find,
even for the luckiest person.

222
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,990
Don't you think?

223
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,200
Lieutenant Park Hae Young?

224
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,550
It was luck, wasn't it?

225
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,320
Do you really need to ask?

226
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,360
What kind of work do I do?

227
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,410
It was through Yoon Soo Ah.

228
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,390
I found it through profiling.

229
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,040
That's just basic stuff.

230
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,840
All right then.

231
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,660
I'll see you all again with a smile
on my face after my break.

232
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,190
He profiled Yoon Soo Ah
even before we caught her?

233
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,130
That kid.

234
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,190
He's digging with a shovel
in front of a Poclain machine.

235
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,420
Look at him lying in front a detective.

236
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,200
Park Hae Young?

237
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,550
You're certain it's Park Hae Young
of the cold case squad?

238
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,500
He was asking details about
Detective Lee Jae Han.

239
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,890
<i>I answered properly.</i>

240
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,270
You didn't make mistakes, did you?

241
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,500
I answered just like I did
fifteen years ago.

242
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,450
Don't call me for the next while
and act like you normally do.

243
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,510
Don't go on any trips either.

244
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,710
- Do as you usually do.
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

245
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,310
<i>When? 11:23 at night.</i>

246
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,500
<i>Duration of time? Not yet confirmed.</i>

247
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,610
<i>First transmission, year 2000.</i>

248
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,230
<i>Lieutenant Park. It's me, Lee Jae Han.</i>

249
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,980
<i>Second transmission, year 1989.</i>

250
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,710
<i>Officer 22, Yongsan precinct.
Who is this?</i>

251
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,530
<i>Where? There is no consistent location.</i>

252
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,290
<i>Who? Detective Lee Jae Han.</i>

253
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,840
<i>I haven't sent and received
transmissions with anyone else yet.</i>

254
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,650
<i>Would it be possible if it were not
Detective Lee Jae Han?</i>

255
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,120
<i>I can't confirm.</i>

256
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,670
<i>What? How? Why?</i>

257
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,670
<i>Why?</i>

258
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,200
Sun Woo...

259
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Did you wait long?

260
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,740
- Sun Woo.
- Yeah?

261
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,800
Why do people need to sleep?

262
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,980
Because you worked hard all day,
so your brain is telling you to rest.

263
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Why do people need to work so hard?

264
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
That way, you make money.

265
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,630
Like Mom and Dad.

266
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,840
Then do other kids not see
their parents much either?

267
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,670
They never come home saying
they're making money.

268
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,940
Hae Young, you have so much
you're curious about.

269
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,660
I bet you'll grow up into a great person.

270
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,910
Why?

271
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,820
It means you have that much interest
in what's going on in the world.

272
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,550
Oh really?

273
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,140
Then... how come the postman
rings the doorbell two times?

274
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,660
Huh?

275
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,720
Why does a parrot cry with its body?

276
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,020
<i>[Parrot, Cried With It's Body]</i>
Does a parrot cry with its body?

277
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>[A Stolen Apple Tastes Better]</i>
Why does a stolen apple taste better?

278
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,430
A stolen apple?

279
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,760
Yeah.

280
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,100
<i>Transmissions don't come everyday.</i>

281
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
<i>But the times stay the same.</i>

282
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,710
<i>11:23 p.m.</i>

283
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,680
<i>I estimate that the duration
is approximately a minute.</i>

284
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,820
<i>I can't be sure.</i>

285
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,470
<i>We saved Lee Mi Sun through
our transmissions.</i>

286
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,520
<i>Choi Young Shin and Jung Kyung Soon,
who should not have died, died.</i>

287
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,500
<i>If the past changes...</i>

288
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,070
<i>the present will change.</i>

289
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,650
<i>[September 10, 1995]</i>

290
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
Who's there?

291
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,630
- Where is he?
- Which way?

292
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,490
- Over there!
- That way.

293
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,960
Hurry up!

294
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,080
Get him! We got him.

295
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
We got him.

296
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,070
Why are you grabbing me?

297
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,450
Did you get him?

298
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,510
What are you all doing?

299
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,660
How embarrassing, seriously.

300
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,170
- Let him go.
- What?

301
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,850
- Let him go.
- Let go of me, would you?

302
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,170
Why the heck are you grabbing my leg?

303
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,490
Don't you see this?
I came out to poop during the stake out.

304
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,250
What happened? Did we get him?

305
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,800
You idiots!

306
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,290
How many of you are there
that you can't even catch him?

307
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,020
You can't even catch the culprit.
How can you go take a dump?

308
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,410
You can't catch the guy.
How can you even eat that bread?

309
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,830
Gosh, what's that smell?

310
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,070
I can't catch him so why
should I wash myself.

311
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,900
I haven't washed myself this whole time.

312
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,750
Where were you running
when you got caught?

313
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,820
Where would I be running to?

314
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,540
I heard someone shout "over there",
so I ran over there.

315
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,900
How about you?

316
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,050
I ran over there too.

317
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,840
So why wasn't the criminal over there?

318
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,310
There were a bunch of cops on the scene.

319
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,010
Where did he run off to?

320
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,980
For someone who couldn't catch the guy,
you sure are very curious.

321
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,920
For someone who couldn't catch the guy,
you sure aren't curious enough.

322
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,740
These are the ex-cons in Seoul
that are skilled at using crowbars.

323
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,440
Take some each and search them
or do whatever you need to.

324
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,930
Bring me anyone who looks suspicious.

325
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,220
Chief, we already looked
through them all.

326
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,790
It has to be one of these people.

327
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,050
Could there be many people
who know have to open a safe like that.

328
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,370
As of yesterday, it's been four homes.

329
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,710
A congressman was robbed.

330
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,360
And a chairman of a company.

331
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,810
As well as a high-flying
lead prosecutor was robbed.

332
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,080
Before the Superintendent
get fired over this

333
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,970
go catch the criminal. Now!

334
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,060
Okay.

335
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,990
- Is it this car?
- Oh, you scared me!

336
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,320
Wow, this car is nice. It must be new.

337
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,630
It's used.

338
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,850
Where did you get the money?

339
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,750
I borrowed it from someone I know.

340
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,530
Kyung Tae, what were you
doing last night?

341
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,360
It's not me.

342
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,920
Did I say it was?

343
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,250
It really wasn't.

344
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,850
When I caught you four years ago,
you said it really wasn't you.

345
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,410
Anyway, it really isn't me this time.

346
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,570
Hey, you got promoted because
you arrested me that time.

347
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,160
Who's the one who made that
little officer into a detective?

348
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,650
You should be thankful.

349
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah, so what were you doing last night?

350
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,840
You really shouldn't be like this.

351
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,130
How many times was I an informant
for you after getting out of jail?

352
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,590
So just tell me what you did last night
instead of changing subjects.

353
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,350
What else? I slept.

354
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,000
You try driving all day.
You'll fall right to bed at that time.

355
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,860
Really, I've washed my hands
clean of it this time.

356
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,180
Eun... Eun Ji! Eun Ji!

357
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,490
Oh, Eun Ji!

358
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,050
Don't you dare bring up
the burglaries in front of Eun Ji.

359
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,650
Just watch what you say.

360
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,930
- Come on, it's cold.
- Come on.

361
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,620
- Why is it so cold today?
- Yeah, it sure is.

362
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,040
Are you here about the burglaries?

363
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,000
Burg...

364
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,040
I doubt it.

365
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,990
Eat once the stew is out.

366
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,800
- The kimchi is good, huh?
- Yeah, you made some.

367
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
- Eun Ji made it.
- It's really good.

368
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,210
Wow.

369
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,750
- Eun Ji did it all herself.
- You should have helped her.

370
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,260
Goodness...

371
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,820
You should be studying.
You don't have any time for this.

372
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,490
I told you I'd just go home.

373
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,490
You must always eat out.
That's not good for you, Uncle.

374
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,750
Thank you.

375
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,780
Eat.

376
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,420
Oh wow, this is good.

377
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,970
You do well in school
and you can cook too.

378
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,960
There's nothing you can't do well.

379
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,840
About the burglaries...

380
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,280
Hey, I really didn't come here
because of that.

381
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,850
It's the work of an amateur.

382
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,520
Think about it.

383
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,650
Why would a pro make things
into such a big debacle?

384
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,390
There's no point in
aggravating detectives

385
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,000
and losing their source of income.

386
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,320
What would you know, kid?

387
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,910
I lived with my dad for twelve years.

388
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,500
While he was in jail for four years,
you took care of me, Uncle.

389
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,250
My life has been violent crimes.
You don't think I'd pick up that much?

390
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,830
You're just a kid.

391
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,720
I heard you haven't even
found the stolen items.

392
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,900
This isn't someone being careful.
This person doesn't know the root.

393
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,670
My daughter is smart.

394
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,270
You must be so proud.

395
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,720
A junior high kid knows more
about burglary than math.

396
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,870
- Are you happy about that?
- She's good at math too.

397
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,030
But isn't it a little strange?

398
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,910
What?

399
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,310
The work is definitely an amateur,
but it's too easy.

400
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,630
These are incredibly rich households,
the security would be quite something.

401
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,450
He got in too easy.

402
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,020
Do you think it's someone they know?

403
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,420
Why don't you just become a detective?

404
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,610
A detective and criminal are
actually not that different.

405
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,980
Eat you rice, okay?
The stew is good. Eat this.

406
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,450
What is in this thing?

407
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,340
You never know what will
happen to your uncle.

408
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,000
I'll be going now.

409
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,950
Eun Ji, you don't need to come out.

410
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,220
Uncle.

411
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,920
Yes?

412
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,280
I think of you as my real uncle.

413
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,950
What's with you, kid?

414
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,150
You trust me, right?

415
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,250
It really isn't Dad.

416
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,120
It really isn't him.

417
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,540
Okay.

418
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,880
I got it so you should head back in.
It's cold out.

419
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,490
Oh, and take this.

420
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,170
What is it?

421
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,000
I made an extra one while I made Dad's.

422
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,520
To listen to while you drive.

423
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,400
Bye now.

424
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,130
That kid...

425
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,250
You haven't been home in two weeks,
and you're leaving again?

426
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,080
Is this because of that burglar?

427
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,670
I'm just going to change my clothes
and head out, so please go to bed.

428
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,820
You got a new talisman again?

429
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,420
Yeah, you're better because of that.

430
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,520
You're not hearing weird transmissions
anymore, right?

431
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,650
I told you that I heard it wrong.

432
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,490
Don't take it off.
It cost a lot of money.

433
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,370
Gosh, all this laundry.

434
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,910
I told you to put it all out at once.

435
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,870
Answer me.

436
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,630
Who is the culprit?

437
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,180
I must be going crazy. I really am.

438
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,940
I'm going to get you.

439
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,280
I shot you.

440
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,970
Aunt, what kind of dead person talks?

441
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
Okay.

442
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,740
The corpse is dead again!

443
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,150
I got you again.

444
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,360
If you keep stepping on a detective,
she'll arrest you.

445
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,470
Is she sleeping or playing with them?

446
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:36,460
Hey, that's not permanent marker
on her forehead, is it?

447
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,460
She has a marriage setup date tomorrow.

448
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,870
Take a look at this. Pretty, right?

449
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,910
I bought this at the department store
when it was on sale.

450
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,160
Mom, please stop dressing her in pink.

451
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,760
Even the blankets and curtains...
Is this a fortune teller shop?

452
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,520
Who is it tomorrow?

453
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,610
A lawyer.

454
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,270
Well, he is a lawyer, but...

455
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,340
Besides the fact that he's bald,
apparently he's perfect.

456
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,960
Sounds perfect.

457
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,320
The wife can bring in the clients
and the husband can be their lawyer.

458
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,760
You little rascals!
I told you to be careful.

459
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,670
I just can't deal with this.

460
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,380
Oh no! Get over here, you two.

461
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,360
Get out of here, seriously!

462
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,330
Be careful! I can't believe this.

463
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,780
Sorry.

464
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,680
<i>[Jinyang Precinct Lee Jae Han]</i>

465
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,430
What is it? Is it important?

466
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,450
No.

467
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,440
Seriously, you two!
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?

468
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,760
Get over here now. Stay still.

469
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Stay there right now.

470
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,470
I cannot deal with you two.

471
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,020
Hurry up and get over here. Stay put.

472
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,360
<i>Detective Lee Jae Han, are you there?</i>

473
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,850
Lieutenant Park Hae Young?

474
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,090
I couldn't get in touch with you,
so I was worried.

475
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,220
<i>Nothing much has happened, right?</i>

476
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,260
Is this really Lieutenant Park Hae Young
that I'm speaking to?

477
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,340
What have you been doing for six years?

478
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,540
Six years?

479
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,210
Then are you saying...

480
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,130
It's the year 1995 over there?

481
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,970
What about you?

482
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,740
It's still the year 2015 here.

483
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,750
It's only been one week
since I last spoke to you.

484
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,630
Is it really the year 2015 over there?

485
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,400
Are you playing around here?
Are you really Park Hae Young?

486
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,170
I really am the Park Hae Young who caught

487
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,360
the Gyeonggi Nambu
serial killer with you.

488
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,590
<i>We spoke five times
over radio transmissions.</i>

489
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,470
In your time, the transmissions ended
after November 11, 1989.

490
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,260
This is really crazy.

491
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,860
I really don't understand this either.

492
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,110
I am in 2015.

493
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,150
Let's just say that you are then.
I'll ask you for a favor.

494
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,370
Who is responsible for the multiple
burglaries that occurred in 1995?

495
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,950
You would know if you are in 2015.

496
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,110
That case is still unsolved.

497
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,840
Unsolved?

498
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,170
We suffer this much
and still don't catch the guy?

499
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,900
- Are you sure?
- I am.

500
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,800
It was an old case

501
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,090
so we couldn't get the original
investigation files.

502
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,190
But it was a famous case.

503
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,500
I did create a profile
using newspaper articles.

504
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,680
A pro... what?

505
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,430
Profiling.

506
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,190
It's an investigation technique
that has developed since then.

507
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,510
And even though I know it,
I can't teach it to you.

508
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,980
It's dangerous to change
the past too carelessly.

509
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,760
I have to catch this culprit.

510
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,760
All right, then when is the next house
going to be robbed?

511
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,250
<i>Yesterday was the fourth house.
When is the next house?</i>

512
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,820
That is the last house.

513
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,820
After the fourth house,
he didn't go to anymore houses.

514
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,860
Lieutenant.

515
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,590
We haven't been able
to go home for a month now.

516
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,280
All of our crap on the streets
could fill up a truck.

517
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,300
Give me something to go on here.

518
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,530
There's almost nothing revealed
about that case.

519
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,410
No one used a similar M.O.
to commit the crime afterward.

520
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,340
The stolen items have yet
to be discovered.

521
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,070
Why don't you do that profiling
or pro-wresting thing?

522
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,180
You said it's a better
investigation technique.

523
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,670
Catching one thief isn't going
to ruin the peace of mankind.

524
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,020
How dangerous could it be?

525
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,900
We have to catch the bad guys.

526
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,960
Are any of the suspects
an acquaintance of a victim?

527
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,210
We haven't been able
to specify a suspect.

528
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,460
We've excluded family and employees
from the suspect list.

529
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,300
Then let's assume an outsider
forced his way inside.

530
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,000
All the houses were rich households,
difficult to enter and escape from.

531
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,590
From the fact that he only
took expensive items

532
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,590
there must have been a way for him
to get inside information.

533
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,130
He may have touched fixtures
outside the house

534
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,670
to figure out the level of security.

535
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,320
Like a security system
or the main entrance lock.

536
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,080
For entry points, he would've
checked the garage or the wall

537
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,750
and the back door.

538
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,280
In order to find out about the residents

539
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,970
he would've looked through the mailbox,
the garbage, and the newspaper bag.

540
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,580
These are not hard facts.

541
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,080
<i>But they're based on
newspaper articles.</i>

542
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,840
<i>Just use this information
as reference.</i>

543
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,260
And you have to be careful.

544
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,810
<i>These transmissions...</i>

545
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,110
have caused those
who shouldn't have died to die.

546
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,160
Lieutenant Park Hae Young?
Lieutenant Park Hae Young?

547
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,730
Lieu...

548
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,600
<i>If the past changes,
the present changes.</i>

549
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,560
<i>[Burglary Case 1995]</i>

550
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,130
It's not my dad. It's not him!

551

<i>[Unsolved, Burglary Case]</i>

554
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
Oh my.

555
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,900
You suffered so much.

556
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,590
Over here. Young Soo.

557
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,180
2005, the Lee Chan San case.

558
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,230
Right, we almost forgot that one.

559
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,800
What are you guys doing?

560
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,180
I guess you could call it
the future of our cold case squad.

561
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,160
Look.

562
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:42,520
I've gathered here all the famous
cold cases in our country.

563
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,340
We solved the Gyeonggi Nambu case,
after all.

564
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,730
These shouldn't be a problem.

565
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,140
Wouldn't your family complain if you
suddenly start working so much?

566
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,550
What do you mean?
Work comes before family.

567
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,400
What do you think of
the "Jack the Ripper" case?

568
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,400
What is that? Is that an organized gang?

569
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,510
"Jack the Ripper".

570
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,550
Don't you know?
It's a serial murder case in England.

571
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,670
About the burglary case of 1995...

572
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,710
the investigation files
are no longer around.

573
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,950
Is there anyone around that
knows about that case?

574
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,740
Why do you care about that one
when the culprit has been caught?

575
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,440
We're the cold case squad.

576
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,670
I think he's already served his time too.

577
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,850
Do you know about it?

578
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,940
I read in the papers that
his sentence was severe.

579
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,280
But he tried to escape,
so his prison term was extended.

580
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,800
The evidence was very clear,
but he says it wasn't him.

581
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,330
He says he isn't guilty.

582
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,730
He insisted it so much that
he got his term extended.

583
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,240
How do you know that, kid?

584
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,650
In 1995, you were probably
still breast feeding.

585
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,960
- I saw it on "Samong".
- Samong?

586
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,500
What language is that?

587
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,470
That's a shortened version.

588
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,250
For an association for information
on our nation's top cases.

589
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,120
He's right.

590
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,650
They had a statement from a witness.

591
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,190
They even found fingerprints
on the scene.

592
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,000
If you want to be precise,
it wasn't on the scene.

593
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,840
It was on the mailbox.

594
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,050
It was found on the mailbox?

595
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,880
In order to find out about the residents

596
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,810
he would've looked through the mailbox,
garbage, and the newspaper bag.

597
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,050
Okay, okay. Let's forget all that.

598
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,000
Let's focus on Oh Dae Yang.

599
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,940
How do we go about investigating this?

600
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,840
I heard that the Special Task Force
was investigating it at the time.

601
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,730
How would I meet those detectives?

602
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,210
Why would you want to know that?
Why, why, why?

603
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,510
I'm curious too.

604
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,800
Why do you want to know?

605
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,510
Answer me.

606
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,550
Why do you want to know?

607
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,170
They say it's been twenty years.

608
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:01,220
What if they arrested the wrong person,
what if it's not the right guy?

609
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,020
And it's been twenty years...
That's just not right.

610
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,440
Yeah, but aren't you curious
about the Oh Dae Yang case?

611
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,160
What is it now? What?

612
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,350
I am not curious about Oh Dae Yang.

613
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,460
Okay, then we can take out Oh Dae Yang.

614
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,960
Look, we have the Daehan Hwahak case.

615
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,570
Gosh, this is just...

616
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,800
Are you going to see
one of the detectives?

617
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,970
What's his name?

618
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,420
You should ask the names
of those people from them.

619
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,210
Why ask someone who wasn't there?

620
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,350
What?

621
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,380
Give it to me.

622
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,270
That was really good.
You're just my type.

623
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,380
Welcome!

624
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,810
Aren't you going to show me to my room?
Not interested in my business?

625
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,230
Let's go this way.

626
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,100
What are we doing here?

627
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,540
Get me the most expensive bottle
of alcohol and snacks.

628
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,690
Some pretty girls would be nice too.

629
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,870
Girls? Are you crazy?

630
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,940
Is there anything else you need?

631
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,470
I really didn't do it this time.

632
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,770
I didn't know she was a minor.

633
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:57,030
Once I found out, I gave her money
and sent her home.

634
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,070
Ma'am, don't you believe me?

635
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,510
Why are you calling me "Ma'am"?
You're a year older than me.

636
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,650
Then maybe you shouldn't speak
informally to me.

637
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,100
Do you want die?

638
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,910
You always act like this and then you--

639
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,090
I don't have any business with you today.

640
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,750
Ask your questions if you're curious.

641
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,260
He has five convictions
for larceny under his belt.

642
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,860
Why are you bringing up
my past convictions?

643
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,010
I came to ask you about
the burglaries of 1995.

644
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,550
Who is he?

645
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,530
I'm Park Hae Young, the profiler
for Seoul's cold case squad.

646
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,800
A profiler?

647
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,020
You're the guy who shows up at the end
once everything's been taken care of?

648
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,410
Who says that?

649
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,650
All the detectives that
I'm friendly with.

650
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,800
Speak formally to him.
He's a detective too.

651
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,360
Hey, come on.

652
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,770
He looks like a kid to me.
He's like a newborn baby.

653
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,510
That's right.

654
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,650
And this young person here
is a detective.

655
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,250
Why are you doing this?

656
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,580
Are you looking down on cops?

657
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,330
If you're going to act like that,
then live by the law.

658
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,000
Please, ask whatever you'd like.

659
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,470
Do you know Oh Kyung Tae, the person
who was arrested for those crimes?

660
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,730
Ah, he's like a legend.

661
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,630
He has such clean methods,
so there are a lot of talks about him.

662
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,610
Make sure to take your medication.

663
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,380
Don't forget to go to
the hospital tomorrow.

664
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,260
I'll call you when I arrive.

665
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,820
<i>Once he determines his target</i>

666
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,030
<i>he would hang around
that area for several days.</i>

667
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,980
<i>They say he finds
a natural method to gain entry.</i>

668
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:20,520
<i>Your system has been set.
Please rest comfortably.</i>

669
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,440
<i>They say he's so meticulous and detailed
that he's never left a fingerprint.</i>

670
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,510
Something is off.

671
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,820
Even if a situation changes,
a person doesn't change at his core.

672
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:46,000
If that man is correct,
Oh Kyung Tae is detailed and precise.

673
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,370
A person like that wouldn't leave
his fingerprints on the mailbox.

674
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,830
Do you want to look into it more?

675
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,610
If you just give me an introduction,
I'll look into it on my own.

676
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,610
I am a cop that graduated
from the Police University.

677
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,690
I can take care of my own work.

678
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,290
You don't have to help me
with every little thing.

679
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,790
I thought you were all grown up,
but I see you're far from it.

680
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,370
Did you think I was helping you?

681
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,690
I came out with you because
I need to find something out.

682
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,080
What do you mean?

683
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,840
I can't work with someone
that keeps secrets.

684
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,440
This burglary case...

685
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,650
What's the real reason
you're curious about it?

686
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,710
What... what do you--

687
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,650
Why are you curious about a case
you don't know much about?

688
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,920
Yes, what is it?

689
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,040
<i>Things are crazy here.</i>

690
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,760
Have you checked it out?
Look into the victim's finances now!

691
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,370
What's going on?

692
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,780
There's been a kidnapping.
This guy must be totally insane.

693
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,850
In this day and age

694
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,790
if you catch a kidnapper,
you're automatically promoted.

695
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,850
So all the detectives
are running around like mad.

696
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:02,740
And the victim?

697
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,020
She's a professor at a university.

698
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,940
Her father is the CEO
of Yangwoon Construction.

699
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,530
He's a bigwig who may even run for

700
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,120
the proportional representative
next year.

701
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,430
Do you know who the suspect is?

702
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:14,030
Get into the meeting room now!

703
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:20,060
The suspect is...
Gosh, my timing.

704
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,850
Life is all about timing.

705
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,440
The victim is Shin Yeo Jin, age 37.

706
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,560
She works as an art professor
at Mun Kwang University.

707
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,130
She was kidnapped on
November 1 at 9:00 p.m.

708
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,100
Her parents had left home, and reported
the kidnapping when they returned.

709
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,880
The case was passed onto
Seoul Metropolitan right after.

710
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,040
A suspicious figure was seen
carrying a bag out on CCTV.

711
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,520
This person was identified by a print
found on Shin Yeo Jin's mirror.

712
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:53,130
The fingerprint was found in the house
and his face was captured on CCTV.

713
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,640
The suspect's name is Oh Kyung Tae.

714
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,480
Age 58. He was arrested
for multiple robberies in 1995.

715
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,240
He was put in prison for his crimes

716
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,760
and was released three days ago.

717
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,240
Oh Kyung Tae used a vehicle that
he had prepared in advance.

718
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,010
He used the Kyungjin Highway all
the way to Gyeonggi-do Leechun.

719
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,660
We haven't been able to determine
his location after that.

720
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,920
The victim's card and phone
have not been used.

721
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,340
The victim's phone has been turned off,
so location by GPS is impossible.

722
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,730
- What about Oh Kyung Tae?
- Yes.

723
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,310
He hasn't been out long,
so he has no phone, cards, or address.

724
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,030
Locating the suspect is very urgent.

725
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,820
Once a piece of garbage,
always a piece of garbage.

726
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:40,330
He went to jail for robbing people,
and he does it again as soon as he's out.

727
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:42,440
There's nothing more to hear then.

728
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,550
He did it for money.

729
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,370
But there was no cash,
so he took the person instead.

730
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,910
Something is off here.

731
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,780
Oh Kyung Tae has never touched
a person before.

732
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,350
He has only ever committed larceny.

733
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,100
His method of crime has changed as well.

734
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,880
He left his fingerprints
and got caught on CCTV.

735
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,220
It isn't like Oh Kyung Tae.

736
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,540
Oh Kyung Tae has another motive
for committing this crime.

737
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,350
They will get a blackmail call.

738
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,720
- So what I'm saying is--
- Be ready for that.

739
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,090
Talk to everyone he worked with.
Friends, cellmates in jail...

740
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,160
The golden time for
a kidnapping is within 24 hours.

741
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,020
Look everywhere in Seoul
and find Oh Kyung Tae!

742
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,420
Yes, sir.

743
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,730
Superintend...

744
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:38,200
Start where his car was left behind
and look through every CCTV you can.

745
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,990
That includes car black boxes too.

746
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,350
I want every officer
in this precinct working on this.

747
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,730
- That's it.
- Yes, sir.

748
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,920
Wait, wait!

749
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,590
Wait. Hold on!

750
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,280
You solve the Gyeonggi Nambu case
and you think you can behave like this?

751
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,090
Where do you think are
to step up like that?

752
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,420
You're right.

753
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,240
I forgot how hard it is to communicate
people in the police organization.

754
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,430
I apologize. I'll take care of it.

755
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,340
Cha Soo Hyun, join the team
that's with the family.

756
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,330
- Jung Hun Ki, help out on scene.
- Yes.

757
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,940
- Kim Gye Chul, provide support here.
- Yes.

758
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,680
You, get lost.

759
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,510
Gosh, seriously.

760
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,250
You must feel great now.

761
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,720
Did you become a cop so that
you could fight other cops?

762
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,210
Don't try to lecture me.

763
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,110
I don't want to work
with any of you either.

764
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:48,010
They have no skills and too much pride,
and that's why we can't catch criminals.

765
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,730
This case is not a simple kidnapping.

766
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,290
Oh Kyung Tae has always been meticulous.

767
00:57:55,290 --> 00:58:00,300
But he left his prints on the mirror
and let himself show up on CCTV.

768
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,060
He has a deeper motive behind this

769
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,050
and the kidnapping
could mean more to him.

770
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,720
Then the victim's life is in danger.

771
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,610
Yeah, so say you are right
and that victim's life is in danger.

772
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,090
Then you killed that victim.

773
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,410
You should have tried harder
to convince them.

774
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,030
If you keep acting this way...

775
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,920
no one will listen to you.

776
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,950
And someone could die every time.

777
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,590
Do whatever you want.

778
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
I don't know why you hate
the police so much.

779
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,650
But if you can't handle the pain of
being unable to catch the culprit

780
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,370
then you don't have the right
to curse the police.

781
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,700
You know that CCTV
and that one over there?

782
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,080
Can we take a look?

783
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:01,870
Is that okay?

784
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,380
Yes, it is.

785
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,000
Oh Kyung Tae?

786
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,860
He tried to escape a few times,
but he failed.

787
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,050
He was quiet after that.

788
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,080
He learned some electronics skills too,
and didn't talk much.

789
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,980
He kidnapped someone
as soon as he got out.

790
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,230
I need to know why Oh Kyung Tae did that.

791
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,840
I'm not really sure.
He didn't cause much trouble.

792
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,550
He spent his time alone.

793
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,690
Also, he would often get into fits.

794
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,400
The other prisoners
stayed away from him.

795
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,650
Fits?

796
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,160
Eun Ji... No!

797
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,780
<i>What happened inside the prison?</i>

798
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,840
There was nothing related
to fire in his arrest report.

799
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,120
His daughter died. She burned in a fire.

800
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,520
Is anyone there?

801
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,470
Is anyone out there?

802
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,020
These are antidepressants, right?

803
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,670
Did you daughter have an chronic illness?

804
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:33,590
Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.

805
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:37,000
She was in a big accident
when she was young.

806
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,050
An accident?

807
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,970
Do you remember
the Hanyoung Bridge accident?

808
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,270
My daughter was on that bridge.

809
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:19,260
What happened on that day?

810
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,700
It's your fault!

811
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,620
It's your fault, you bastard!

812
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,740
My Eun Ji.

813
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:56,040
If you hadn't arrested me...

814
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,030
If I had been next to her,
I could have saved her.

815
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,530
It's all your fault!

816
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,100
Detective, it's me Park Hae Young.

817
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,000
Detective, are you listening?

818
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,500
What happened?

819
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,230
The past has changed
with the burglary case.

820
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,730
Is Oh Kyung Tae actually guilty?

821
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,820
Lieutenant...

822
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:40,060
Detective, Oh Kyung Tae
has kidnapped someone.

823
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,320
He's going to kill that person.

824
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,650
Exactly what happened that day?

825
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,980
We were wrong.

826
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,930
No, no... I was...

827
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,010
I did everything wrong.

828
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,110
Everything...

829
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,550
is ruined because of me.

830
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,640
These transmissions...

831
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,090
should never have started.

832
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,520
What are you saying?

833
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:44,260

<i>The victim has called.
Her phone is on.</i>

839

<i>Why are you doing this us? Why?</i>

<i>Every person has a level.</i>

841
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,030
<i>Are cops usually like this?</i>

842
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,800
<i>- Where is Lee Jae Han, that punk?
- Are you crazy?</i>

843
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,050
<i>- Take care it now.
- Who? Who said that?</i>

844
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,960
<i>I heard from a witness
who saw the accident.</i>

845
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,480
Who is the witness?<i></i>

846

<i>- Are you ready to go.
- Yes.</i>

<i>- Let's go.
- Let's go.</i>

<i>Stop, stop!</i>

849
