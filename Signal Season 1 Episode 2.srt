00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,520
<i>All right, should we move on
to our next matter of business?</i>

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,240
<i>Lieutenant Park Hae Young, right?</i>

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,150
<i>As if that wasn't enough,
you sold tips to a reporter for money?</i>

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>Get a new start before it's too late.</i>

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,830
<i>You're not suited to be a cop.</i>

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,710
<i>Seriously? Till the end?</i>

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>Lieutenant Park.
I'm Detective Lee Jae Han.</i>

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>Who are you?
Sunil Psychiatric Hospital?</i>

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,620
<i>It's Seo Hyung Joon, the suspect
of the Kim Yoon Jung case.</i>

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>That radio had no batteries.
It makes no sense.</i>

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,530
<i>What's with you?</i>

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,440
<i>How did you know that was
Seo Hyung Joon's corpse?</i>

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,770
<i>Hand me all the files
on the remains.</i>

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,260
<i>We have 29 hours left until statute
of limitations comes into effect.</i>

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,830
<i>We couldn't solve it for 15 years.</i>

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,210
<i>Do you think you can
solve it in that time?</i>

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,450
<i>But I saw the culprit.
It was a woman who took Yoon Jung.</i>

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,580
<i>You're done now! It's over now.</i>

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,290
<i>- Are you crazy?
- This is our last chance.</i>

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,450
<i>If something goes wrong,
I'll take full responsibility.</i>

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,590
<i>I'm calling because of
Kim Yoon Jung's abduction case.</i>

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,990
<i>Cha Soo Hyun commands
and Team 2 supports.</i>

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,380
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,440
<i>This woman isn't her.</i>

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,310
<i>The kidnapping case
15 years ago, and now!</i>

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>She's showing off her criminal tactics.</i>

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,750
<i>She figured out the time left until
the statute of limitation and called.</i>

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,560
<i>I'm sure she's close by.</i>

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>She's probably watching to see
how we're being manipulated.</i>

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,840
Yoon Soo Ah.

32
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,010
<i>[20 minutes before the statute
of limitations comes into effect]</i>

33
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>[Episode 2]</i>

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,760
<i>[10 minutes before statute
of limitations comes into effect]</i>

35
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,230
Let me borrow this.

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,410
I said we should just put the fix in.

37
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,620
Don't you think she knows that?

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,050
Do you think this is 1988?
What do you mean we fix it?

39
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,130
- Where do you think you are, punk?
- We need just three to five minutes.

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,020
If we have strong evidence,
culprits falter in three to five minutes.

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,890
If we can do that to Yoon Soo Ah,
we might have a chance.

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,470
Yoon Soo Ah, you are currently
working at Young In Hospital.

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,640
You make 3.5 million won a month.
You live in a luxury Gangnam villa.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,190
You must not have much left after rent,
maintenance fee, food, and travel.

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,430
Yet, you had many
designer goods in your cabinet.

46
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,450
You must have a decent boyfriend
at this time too.

47
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,690
Like Seo Hyung Joon 15 years ago.

48
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,890
I don't know what you're talking about.

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,430
You showed us the cabinet yourself.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,930
Though you lied and said it belonged
to Nurse Kang Sae Young.

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,930
Why did you lie?

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,740
I wanted to know if the police were
doing a good job investigating.

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,540
You lost the culprit because of you
were fooled by lies before.

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,050
<i>If you couldn't apprehend
the kidnapper again...</i>

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,400
that dead child would be so pitiful.

56
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,360
So you are saying that cabinet
is really yours?

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,950
- Yes.
- And the belongings in it are all yours?

58
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,570
Yes.

59
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,490
Thank you.

60
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,180
We gained some time thanks to you.

61
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm saying thank you for giving us
your DNA without conflict.

62
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,430
She is in a defensive position.

63
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,980
She's nervous and wondering
what she could have missed.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,940
We need to get a confession
in the next three to five minutes.

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,530
Why? Are you wondering what
we'll use your DNA for?

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,980
Do you remember that manhole
from 15 years ago?

67
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,850
Do you know which daily used item
picks up the most DNA?

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,200
It's used for the persons' eyes
and stays with them all day long.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,210
It's their glasses.

70
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,570
Do you recognize them?

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,270
I think you got something wrong.

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,090
Those are not my glasses.

73
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,930
I know. They're not yours.

74
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,020
These glasses were worn
by Seo Hyung Joon.

75
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,310
You don't know where glasses hold
the most evidence, do you?

76
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,700
The spot that holds the most DNA...

77
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,850
The nose bridge of the glasses.

78
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,960
And whatever gets on the glasses,
the highest chance that it's preserved

79
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,670
is on this hinge right here.

80
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,660
What do you think was found on
Seo Hyung Joon's glasses?

81
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,740
How am I supposed to know?

82
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,170
I'm sure you don't know.

83
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,150
That's why you threw away
this item in the manhole.

84
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,800
On those glasses, the culprit
who killed Seo Hyung Joon...

85
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,570
had left her blood on it.

86
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,850
You're lying.

87
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,470
There's no way you could
find that 15 years later.

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,140
I thought it was a lie too, at first.

89
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,620
But even if a tiny amount
of blood is found there.

90
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,830
Ten years, twenty years...

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Even after a hundred years,
DNA tests are possible.

92
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,440
It's a gift that modern science
has given to blood.

93
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,350
Okay, she's hooked.

94
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,280
This is the crucial moment.

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,250
<i>Yoon Soo Ah, you think you're
the smartest person in the world.</i>

96
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,810
<i>You may think the police
are beneath your feet.</i>

97
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,590
You're wrong this time.

98
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,670
You murdered Seo Hyung Joon 15 years ago
at Sunil Psychiatric Hospital.

99
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,810
You need to turn yourself....

100
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,320
You're crazy!

101
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,190
<i>Why?</i>

102
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,750
<i>In order to hide the fact that you
kidnapped and killed Yoon Jung.</i>

103
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,110
<i>All because you needed 50 million won.</i>

104
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,720
You are guilty of abducting
Kim Yoon Jung

105
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,020
and murdering Seo Hyung Joon.

106
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,510
You're done for now.

107
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,050
Say it.

108
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,000
That you killed them.

109
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,420
You don't have anything.

110
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,620
Irrefutable evidence.

111
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,400
If you have it,
you wouldn't need to do this.

112
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,750
You don't even have time.
You should just be charging me.

113
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,610
Right?

114
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,040
Do you think I'll confess if you do this?

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,940
When are the DNA results coming out?

116
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,530
Have you heard from the forensics lab?

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,140
It wasn't me.

118
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,200
I did work at Sunil Psychiatric Hospital.

119
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,010
But I didn't kill those people.

120
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,090
I have the results.

121
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,500
I have the results of the DNA
on Seo Hyung Joon's glasses.

122
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,440
It was a match to Yoon Soo Ah's DNA.

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,420
The results aren't out yet.

124
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,890
Get him out of there!

125
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,840
We have less than a minute.

126
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,580
You killed them.

127
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,010
Both Seo Hyung Joon and Yoon Jung!

128
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,470
She was a child who wasn't even 12 yet.
And over just 50 million won!

129
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,910
Why did you kill her?

130
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,250
You didn't have to kill her.

131
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,030
You got the money, so why?

132
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,300
Please, please, please.

133
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,480
Please...

134
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,170
I...

135
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,330
<i>[Time left before statute of
limitations goes into effect]</i>

136
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,350
did not kill her.

137
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,010
<i>[Time left before statute of
limitations goes into effect]</i>

138
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,980
<i>[Statute of limitations goes into effect]</i>

139
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,040
Can I leave now?

140
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,200
We have the results.

141
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,610
The DNA is a 99.98% match.

142
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,500
That woman is the culprit.

143
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,760
Why do you tell me that now? Why!

144
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,500
Why now? Why, why!

145
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,210
Senior, I got this from the clothing
on the skeletal remains.

146
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,150
I don't know if it will be helpful.

147
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,780
Yoon Soo Ah.

148
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,800
You are under arrest for the murder
of Seo Hyung Joon 15 years ago.

149
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,420
You have the right to a lawyer.

150
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
And you have the right to remain silence.

151
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,090
What are you doing right now?

152
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,650
We just found out the time of death
for Seo Hyung Joon.

153
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,610
Yoon Jung's statute of limitation
may have gone into effect

154
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,040
but Seo Hyung Joon's statute
of limitations has not.

155
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,690
That's ridiculous.

156
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,250
Take her.

157
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,980
This is nonsense.

158
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,120
Wait a moment.

159
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,040
What about Yoon Jung?

160
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,550
Why can't we do it for my Yoon Jung?

161
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,810
Because we don't know
her specific time of death...

163
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,250
the statute of limitations
is based on an estimate.

164
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,790
Therefore...

165
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,250
Yoon Jung may have passed at
an earlier time than Seo Hyung Joon.

166
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,220
Or she may have died at a later time.

167
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,550
The law is more favorable
for the suspect in this case.

168
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
So...

169
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,570
That woman killed my daughter, right?

170
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,800
Yet, you're saying she won't
be paying for her crimes, right?

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
I am sorry.

172
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,690
Then I'll make her pay.

173
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,680
Get over here.

174
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,250
Hey, get over here!
You killed my precious daughter.

175
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,640
You killed my daughter! Get over here.

176
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,860
You get over here. You awful wench.

177
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,450
You deserve to die.

178
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,520
Where are you?

179
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,180
What kind of law is this?

180
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,700
I waited 15 years for this.

181
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,840
I waited for her to get caught.
All I did was wait for that.

182
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,500
Yoon Jung, I'm so sorry.

183
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,530
Your mom is so sorry.

184
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,790
Please calm down.

185
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,750
How could this happen?

186
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,500
What kind of law is this?
Detective, how could this happen?

187
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,430
How am I supposed to ever face
Yoon Jung again?

188
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,350
Your mom is so sorry, Yoon Jung.

189
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,050
<i>Just who does the statute
of limitations exist for?</i>

190
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,280
<i>Seo Hyung Joon's murder was solved.</i>

191
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,400
<i>Kim Yoon Jung, who was
killed by the same person...</i>

192
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
<i>Her murder will forever
remain unresolved.</i>

193
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,520
According to the new changes
in law made this August

194
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,050
there is no statute of limitations
for crimes after August 1, 2000.

195
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,980
But, what about everything
before that date?

196
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,240
<i>Are the criminals that murdered
before August 1, 2000 innocent?</i>

197
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>For the sake of the victims
who suffered before that date</i>

198
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,600
<i>we need to take a retroactive look
at all major crimes.</i>

199
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,560
That's a very sensitive topic.

200
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,580
Some of these people have already
been declared not-guilty.

201
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,400
"Well, the law has changed,
so you are guilty now."

202
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
We can't do that.

203
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
So the rights of criminals
are important?

204
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,950
And the rights of victims
and families are not?

205
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,260
<i>Even if we can do this retroactively,
it is still a problem.</i>

206
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,830
<i>With cold cases and crimes
committed before the year 2000</i>

207
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,710
<i>there are no evidence or witnesses,
so the chances of solving them are low.</i>

208
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,990
<i>While trying to solve those,
we will lose out on current cases.</i>

209
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,030
<i>Then you will create more cold cases!</i>

210
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,940
They need to make a cold case squad.

211
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,380
Brother!

212
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,580

213
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,760

<i>[Park Sun Woo]</i>

215
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,100
<i>Like the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders</i>

216
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,980
<i>cold cases like this remain
and gives our society pain.</i>

217
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,760
<i>Someone needs to step forward.</i>

218
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,240
He's here.

<i>[Gyeonggi Nambu Serial Murders

220
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,790
Any thoughts on the claims
made by the victim's families?

221
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,200
The police likely can't ignore the volume
of requests made to re-open cold cases.

222
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,260
What do you think about that?

223
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,450
Help us.

224
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>[I'm searching for truth for my child.
Help me find out the truth.]</i>

225
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,810
<i>The citizens are demanding answers.</i>

226
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,230
<i>Can we omit the crimes of a person
once a specific amount of time passes?</i>

227
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,120
<i>Someone must answer that question now.</i>

228
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,910
Let go!

229
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,660
Stop right there. Now!

230
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,630
Hey!

231
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,330
Hey, punk.

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,380
- <i>News on statute of limitations.</i>
- Are you okay?

233
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,550
<i>The second bill to amend
the criminal law passed the Assembly.</i>

234
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,590
<i>Therefore, all criminal cases such as
murder, arson, or kidnapping in Korea</i>

235
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,550
<i>of violent nature, will no longer
have statute of limitations.</i>

236
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,160
<i>Even for the recent case of
Kim Yoon Jung's abduction</i>

237
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,410
<i>there is now hope for that
case to be solved as well.</i>

238
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,280
<i>As the statute of limitations was
removed on crimes before the year 2000</i>

239
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,300
<i>it's also projected that there will be</i>

240
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,470
<i>an increased effort in
cold case investigations.</i>

241
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,510
Those simple people.

242
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,820
We can get rid of
the statute of limitations

243
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,250
but that doesn't mean criminals we
couldn't catch will suddenly get caught.

244
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,050
Don't you agree?

245
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,050
I will be setting up an official
cold case squad in Seoul.

246
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,620
You can be in charge.

247
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,910
You headed that incident,
so this is your punishment.

248
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,020
"Cha Soo Hyun,
Team 1 of Jinyang precinct."

249
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,060
"This person played a large role in
solving the Seo Hyung Joon case"

250
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,740
"that occurred on July 30, 2000."

251
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,770
"As acknowledgment for your skills,
you will be transferred to Seoul."

252
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,040
"You will be a member
of the cold case squad."

253
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,770
Why is this so long?

254
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,400
"Anyway, you have been
appointed to this position."

255
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,500
Get her a new business card,
Detective Choi.

256
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,210
Okay.

257
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,960
I told you to control your temper.

258
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,920
Just look at me.

259
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm like the flowing water.

260
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,440
It's best not to bother
the people above us.

261
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,900
Just think of it as a break.

262
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,590
In the cold case squad.

263
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,920
Gye Chul, you got a transfer order too.

264
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,270
Is it a promotion?

265
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,320
"To the cold case squad."

266
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,720
Detective Choi,
get another business card.

267
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
Okay.

268
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,770
Darn it.

269
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,600
Where is the Chief?
Is he at the sauna?

270
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,500
Senior, you got a transfer order.

271
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,310
These cold cases are
a disgrace to the police.

272
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,550
Opening up these cold cases...

273
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,670
will reveal these disgraces.

274
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,650
Once everyone calms down
about the statute of limitations

275
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,030
it's a department that
will disappear naturally.

276
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,840
Be quiet about it and be aware.

277
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
Just play along.

278
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,870
Like you did 15 years ago
with Lee Jae Han.

279
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,870
I don't think we have
anymore to talk about.

280
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,380
By any chance...

281
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,400
Did a person who looked like this...

282
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,380
come looking for you?

283
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,700
He was about 185 centimeters tall
and was wearing a navy blue shirt.

284
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,330
A detective?

285
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,980
He might not have told you
he was a detective.

286
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,260
I know for certain...

287
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,650
that he said he would
go to see you that day.

288
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,640
Are you sane?

289
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,200
If a detective had come to see me then,
I would have been caught.

290
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,300
I have nothing more to say,
so you should leave.

291
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,410
We can wait for Detective Lee.

292
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,670
That looks good. It does.

293
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,400
Why is it so noisy?

294
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,420
Yes, over here.

295
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,890
- What's going on?
- Come here.

296
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,170
He will be perfect.

297
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,090
- Perfect for what?
- Chief wants you to do it.

298
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,420
This is him?
Let's get started on the shoot.

299
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,620
Started on what shoot?

300
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,670
Hey, what's with you?

301
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,580
- Yes...
- Why aren't you in uniform?

302
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,870
You're an officer.

303
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,730
Are you playing detective?

304
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,900
No, that's not it.

305
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,570
- Here, take this off.
- Hey.

306
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,950
What are you doing?

307
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,020
- Just get in the car.
- What are we doing?

308
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,160
I just got here though.

309
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,200
Can the male detective put a more
intense expression on his face?

310
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,580
Cha Soo Hyun, more strength
in your eyes too.

311
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,500
You have to look like a female detective.
Have some pride!

312
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,800
Hold up the radio. Keep going!

313
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,440
Detective? What detective?

314
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,790
Yes, that's right.

315
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,660
You can't even drive this car.
How can you be a detective?

316
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,470
I'm sorry. You have to suffer too.

317
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,300
Wait, wait, wait.
This is not right.

318
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,130
You should have more life in your eyes.

319
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,890
This is for the next police magazine.
You can't be awkward like that.

320
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,380
Please, one more try.

321
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,120
Let's go once more.

322
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,220
Why didn't they get models? Hey...

323
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,750
Since we're stuck with this,
let's give it a go.

324
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,230
Let's put some strength in the eyes.
Where is Jung Jae, that dog?

325
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's pretend that he's
a criminal and glare at him.

326
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,230
You mean like this?

327
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,490
That's right!

328
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,330
You're dead.

329
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,160
Oh, that's great!
Do that again.

330
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,070
That's exactly what I want.
Be aggressive like that.

331
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,730
- Like this, like this?
- Just like that.

332
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,390
That's it! That's it!

333
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,860
- Is this okay too?
- A little bit more.

334
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,790
Should I come out then?

335
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,870
I like that. Keep going.

336
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,620
Officer Cha, come out of the car.

337
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,450
You should come out.

338
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,540
Bring me that gun.

339
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,040
- Bang!
- That's great!

340
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,720
What are you going to do now?

341
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,870
Yes! That's perfect!

342
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,160
<i>Wow, seriously awesome.</i>

343
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,020
<i>Lee Bo Young and Ji Sung came
at that time just like you said.</i>

344
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,460
<i>They don't even show up late
and are thoughtful of each other.</i>

345
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,570
<i>What's next?</i>

346
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,750
I have no more.

347
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,110
<i>Huh? Why not?</i>

348
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,160
<i>What is it? Why not?</i>

349
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
It's not fun anymore.

350
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,220
<i>What? Hello?</i>

351
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,860
Detective Lee Jae Han?

352
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,360
Detective. It's me, Park Hae Young.

353
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,760
Thanks to you, we solved
the Kim Yoon Jung abduction case.

354
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,950
You saw the news, right?

355
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,170
<i>[August 3, 2000]</i>
But about Sunil Psychiatric Hospital...

356
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,190
<i>How did you know Seo Hyung Joon's
body would be there?</i>

357
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,250
<i>Which precinct are you at?</i>

358
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,430
I looked all over for you,
but I couldn't find you.

359
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,380
Also, how did you know who I was?

360
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,910
Lieutenant Park Hae Young.

361
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,010
I think this might be
my last transmission.

362
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,980
What do you mean...

363
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,440
But this is not the end.

364
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,330
They will start again.

365
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,620
At that time...

366
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,260
you must convince me.

367
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,690
The year will be 1989.

368
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,630
The Lee Jae Han of that time.

369
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,670
<i>It can still change.</i>

370
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,180
<i>Don't ever give up.</i>

371
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,610
What does that mean?

372
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,350
What exactly are you saying?

373
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,520
Detective?

374
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,690
Detective, are you there?

375
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,280
You're all right, aren't you?

376
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,360
Detective.

377
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,310
Detective!

378
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,180
Detective!

379
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,870
<i>They will start again.</i>

380
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,300
<i>At that time...

<i>The year will be 1989.</i>

382

<i>The Lee Jae Han of that time.</i>

383
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,010
I told you that it's not there.
How many times do I have to tell you?

384
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,820
What? Haven't they seen
a detective before?

385
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,970
Hey, get over here.

386
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,540
Take this.

387
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,310
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

388
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,800
I told you to come here.

389
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,600
- I told you not to.
- Why?

390
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,340
What are you doing? Show me the way.

391
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,750
Okay.

392
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,970
Go on now.

393
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,670
They'll be gone in a few months.

394
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,710
Be good to them.

395
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,450
- What did you say?
- Just let it go. Don't.

396
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,350
I told you to go on.

397
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,550
Just let it go.

398
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,710
Just let it go.
They're not even wrong.

399
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,540
Whose side are you on?

400
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,170
The guys here got better.

401
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,350
I think this one here is my style.

402
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,750
Hey, just let it go.

403
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,200
Sometimes in life,
you get crap on your underwear.

404
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,590
What's your name?

405
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,520
My name is Hwang Eui Kyung.

406
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,750
Yeah, so I asked you what is your name.

407
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,980
My name is Eui Kyung.
Hwang Eui Kyung.

408
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
Not even Soon Kyung or Hae Kyung...

409
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,000
It's a name destined for you.

410
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,940
Where is it anyway?

411
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,820
Oh, it's over there.

412
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,520
Why didn't you say so earlier?

413
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,350
Are you training me
like a dog or something?

414
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,420
Are you going to fight everyone?

415
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,630
This is bad, really bad.

416
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,720
Is this a recycling center or what?

417
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,960
This place just has one phone.

418
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,810
There's no computer.
Do they expect us to work or not?

419
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, but we have to work, don't we?

420
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,410
We clean and clean,
but there's no end in sight.

421
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,790
Doesn't the Special Crimes Unit
even clean?

422
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,250
I'm cleaning and cleaning,
but the smell isn't going away.

423
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,900
Why are you spraying that at me?
It's getting in my eyes.

424
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,100
Detective Cha Soo Hyun,
what's with this office?

425
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,350
It makes us look bad.

426
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,060
You should talk to some people.

427
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,680
Whose seat is this?

428
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,010
How would we know?

429
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,070
They said some profiler is coming.
I doubt anyone good will come.

430
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,030
It wouldn't be that kid who mouthed
off about being a profiler.

431
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,860
That mannerless rude jerk, right?

432
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,960
No, no. Be careful of what you say.

433
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,470
It can't be.

434
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,060

You've all been cops for a long time now.

438
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,440
So, I'm sure you all know this case.

439
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,850
The Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders.

440
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,340
This is the most famous
cold case in Korea.

441
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,120
<i>December 3, 1987.</i>

442
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,290
<i>The first victim is discovered
in Gyeonggi Nambu</i>

443
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,920
<i>at road to Ohsung Mountain.</i>

444
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,110
<i>Following that, he has killed
more than ten people.</i>

445
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,190
<i>He binds their hands and feet
behind their back first.</i>

446
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,080
<i>He strangles their throat,
and he ties unique knots.</i>

<i>Someone dies when it rains.</i>

448

<i>You die if you wear red.</i>

449
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,930
<i>People told ghost stories about it.</i>

450
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,750
<i>It was that famous of a case.</i>

451
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,290
Thousands of police were
invested into this in a year.

452
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,430
Though the science was
not developed during that time

453
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,790
it was a shameful case in which we could
not even find the shadow of the criminal.

454
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,420
This is the cold case squad's first case.

455
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,310
We're not even organized here.

456
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,330
The Gyeonggi Nambu serial murder?

457
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,780
Why not just tell us to sit
and take a break?

458
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,200
Detective Cha... that's the Chief.

459
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,330
That's a 26-year-old case.

460
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,760
There are no files or evidence.
How would we investigate?

461
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,170
And with this group...

462
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,110
It's not possible.

463
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,570
I think it's worth a try.

464
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,910
That punk. My feelings weren't wrong.

465
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,110
It's the first case of
the cold case squad.

466
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,870
It should, at least, be something
like the Gyeonggi Nambu case.

467
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,100
Don't you think so?

468
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,710
This is not your
first time meeting, right?

469
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,940
He will be the one to analyze
criminals and their danger level.

470
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,190
Also, he will be in charge
of getting the confessions.

471
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,690
This is Lieutenant Park Hae Young.

472
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,250

Shaman?

475
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,020
He has no related degree or
work experience in the field.

476
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,000
Someone who hasn't even gone through
investigation training is a profiler?

477
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,440
With the little evidence for cold cases,
the profiler is especially important.

478

Don't give me just anyone,
give me someone good.

479

- Cha Soo Hyun.

Don't you have a brain?

You think if you search

you'll get a lot of results on it.

Look here, Lieutenant Park.

495

Clean out your ears and listen carefully.

496

All the hair and blood evidence
is completely gone from the scene.

497

So even if we catch the killer

498

we have no DNA to compare it to.

499

There is no hair or blood
to compare it to, you say?

500

That's what the problem is.

They couldn't even store
evidence properly.

Is there anyone in this nation
who doesn't know that?

505

630
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,280
We have to meet every single one of them.

631
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,540
We need all their files and know
everything they remember.

632
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,700
Then we can start our own investigation.

633
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,760
I'll meet the family of the victims.

634
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,340
Gye Chul, you can meet the detectives
who were on the Violent Crimes team.

635
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,560
Give the files and data
you get to Lieutenant Park.

636
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,840
The evidence will be handled by
Jung Hun Ki. That's it.

637
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,600
Should I go meet the old detectives?

638
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,580
Make sarcastic comments if you want.

639
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,330
I'll investigate this my own way.

640
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,180
Why don't you grow up sometime?

641
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,410
What is this?

642
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,210
It's something called team work.

643
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,450
A senior of mine kept it
and gave it to me.

644
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,820
It's the seventh victim, Lee Gye Sook,
and the eighth at Hyunpoong station.

645
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,750
I promised to give it back,
so you're dead if you lose it.

646
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:59,830
<i>[November 5, 1989]</i>

647
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,900
Let's go.

648
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,080
Is it him again, huh?

649
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,880
What kind of guy is that?
He should tell you if he likes you.

650
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,170
All he does is follow you around.

651
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:17,480
Hey, I guess because he's a cop

652
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,440
he wants to protect
the girl that he likes.

653
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,030
Oh, this was my friend's house.

654
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:47,530
I guess he moved without telling me.
Yeah, he moved.

655
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,510
How noisy.

656
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,110
<i>Is there a cop in this country
who doesn't know that?</i>

657
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:34,190
<i>The seventh was in a field of reeds
by Highway 3.</i>

658
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,560
<i>The eighth was on the train tracks
by Hyunpoong Station.</i>

659
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,340
Hyunpoong Station... train tracks.

660
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:20,170
I can't tell who is who anymore.

661
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,790
Hasn't it been three days already?

662
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,060
You said you saw
someone go by that night.

663
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,230
We have to catch him.

664
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,390
It was really dark at night.

665
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,160
Still, you'll recognize him
if you see him.

666
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,570
I thought you were a marine
when you were young.

667
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,120
When would we get through all of these?

668
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,350
There are many young men
in this neighborhood.

669
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,980
You saw about 200 so far.

670
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,360
You have about 320 more to look at.

671
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,670
Come on. Be strong, okay?

672
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:01,010
Hello there.

673
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,060
Who are you to come in here?

674
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,380
I'm Officer Lee Jae Han
from Youngsan precinct.

675
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,420
I had something to discuss
with the detective in charge.

676
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,420
Where are you looking?
Look at the screen.

677
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,990
That would be me.

678
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,380
Oh, it nothing really.

679
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,290
Do you have someone named
Lieutenant Park Hae Young on your team?

680
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,380
Park Hae Young?

681
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,090
I've never heard that name.
Why are you looking for him?

682
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:27,270
Well, I heard something
weird on the radio.

683
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,430
About the eighth murder occurring on
the Hyunpoong Station train tracks...

684
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:37,090
Seriously? Do you want another person
to die or something?

685
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,010
- No, it's not me. I heard it.
- Get out of here!

686
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,010
Don't you see we're busy?

687
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,970
I'm dying because I can't sleep,
and you come along.

688
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,570
I was just confused by it.

689
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,290
I said get out!

690
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,440
Yes, keep working hard.

691
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:57,190
Gosh, that crazy punk.

692
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,930
You need to keep looking, okay?

693
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,640
Was I hearing things?

694
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,900
Excuse me.

695
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,500
Excuse me...

696
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:36,340
Why is this happening?

697
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:17,850

Where are you!</i>

<i>Are you sick or something?</i>

702
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,490
<i>It's him. The knot is exactly the same.</i>

703
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,270
<i>Everything has been ruined by him!</i>

704

<i>What are you doing here?
Pull out.</i>

705
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,670
<i>- I can't hear.
- I said pull back.</i>

706

<i>I can communicate well
with intellectuals.</i>

707

<i>You must be kidding.
Are you mad?</i>

708
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,220
<i>What do you think it would be like
to get messages from the past?</i>

709
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,730
<i>I will be bold and ask her out.</i>

710

<i>We've found one more victim.
It's the eighth victim.</i>

711
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,940
<i>After Hyunpoong Station,
the killer is being reckless.</i>

712
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,750
<i>Isn't this too strange
to be a coincidence?</i>

713
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,050
<i>You didn't make mistakes, right?</i>

714
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,790
<i>Call in the team on the scene.</i>

715
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,830
<i>Have they been prepared?</i>

716
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,350
<i>You sure sound like the higher-up.</i>

717

<i>I'm sorry. I have no time to explain.</i>

718
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,070
<i>I'm going to turn the car around.</i>

719
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,850
<i>What if there's still a chance?</i>
