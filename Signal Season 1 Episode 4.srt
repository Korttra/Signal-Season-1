<i>Detective Lee Jae Han.</i>

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,820
<i>Officer 22, Gyeonggi Youngsan precinct.
Officer Lee Jae Han here.</i>

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,250
<i>She was found in a field of reeds next
to the thorn tree forest by Highway 3.</i>

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,450
Who are you?

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,890
<i>Do you have a Lieutenant
Park Hae Young on your team?</i>

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,910
<i>- I heard something weird on the radio.
- Get out!</i>

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,690
<i>What do you think it would be like if
you could communicate with the past?</i>

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,250
<i>Who exactly are you!</i>

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>I caught the culprit at
the Hyunpoong train tracks.</i>

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,460
<i>But if you're really in the year 1989,
Choi Young Shin will die.</i>

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,980
<i>Another victim has been found!
She's the eighth victim.</i>

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,440
<i>The reason he wasn't caught was
because of that bus.</i>

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>It's the bus! I'm sure it's bus 95.</i>

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,030
<i>Let's start from the beginning.</i>

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,390
<i>It's him. It's the same knot from before.</i>

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,660
If you really are in the year 1989

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,230
<i>please stop it from happening.</i>

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,700
<i>Kim Won Kyung, officer worker.
Won Kyung...</i>

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,690
Hey! Is anyone here?

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,760
Please, you can save her.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,490
- Please.
- Please.

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,680
Please, please, please, please...

<i>[Episode 4]</i>

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,480
Won Kyung, Won Kyung!

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,480
Won Kyung!

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,790
Hi, is Won Kyung home?

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,690
No, she said she's working late today.

29
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,100
Working late...

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,660
Okay.

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,500
Why, why?

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,240
Won Kyung, Won Kyung!

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,250
Won Kyung.

34
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,890
<i>The ninth victim is Kim Wong Kyung,
an office employee.</i>

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>November 7, 1989 at 9:30 p.m.
On the streets of Hyunpoong-dong.</i>

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,580
Please, please, please...

37
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,950
Sir, have you seen
a young woman by any chance?

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,640
She has light skin and hair down to here.

39
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,170
Over there? Okay.

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,770
Thank you, thank you! Thank you.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,420
Won Kyung!

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,930
You have the results?

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,600
Of course, who am I?
I'm Jung Hun Ki.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,580
- I got something.
- What is it?

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,310
I got the fingerprint result from
the broken piece of glass.

46
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,000
This was the day before
I went to meet Lee Chun Goo.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,150
He knew I'd meet Jung Kyung Soon too,
and went before I did.

48
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,450
Did you say Lee Chun Goo?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,020
These prints belong to Lee Chun Goo.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,790
So the killer is the bus driver
Lee Chun Goo.

51
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,230
Jung Kyung Soon retired in 1990.
Those are the only records we have.

52
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,430
We already told all of this to
the detectives that came earlier.

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,020
- Detectives?
- Yes.

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,010
Were they from Gyeonggi district?

55
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,070
Yes.

56
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,830
Can you take a look at this?

57
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,730
Did they ask you about Bus 95?

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,010
What? Bus 95?

59
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,450
They didn't mention that.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,110
It's a bus that ran 26 years ago.

61
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,860
Is there anyone here that
would know about that bus?

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,730
Hello.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,330
I'm Lieutenant Park Hae Young from
the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

64
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes, I remember.

65
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,600
One of our attendants died back then,
so the atmosphere was very bad.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,530
Was there anything you heard about
what happened back then?

67
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,600
I don't know much about it.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,760
I wasn't working that day.

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,250
I think that Chun Goo
would know about it.

70
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,540
He went to speak to
the police about it back then.

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,970
Do you know Lee Chun Goo well?

72
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,110
Of course, we were both regular drivers.

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,290
But he had to quit after that incident.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,750
Something bad happened.

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,710
What's his name again?

76
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,920
Lee Chun Goo.

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,580
Lee Chun Goo?
He's not a patient here.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,990
He's not a patient here,
he is a patient's guardian.

79
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,680
A guardian?

80
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,950
- What is it?
- Have you met Lee Chun Goo?

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,130
<i>No, not yet.</i>

82
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,950
Lee Chun Goo is the killer.

83
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,800
The fingerprints and CCTV all confirm it.

84
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,620
What's the room number?

85
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,230
Something bad?

86
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,380
His son had an accident.

87
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,270
He wanted to take care of him,
so he got his retirement money and quit.

88
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,890
I haven't seen him since then.

89
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,630
One moment.

90
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,470
This is Park Hae Young.

91
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,900
Get to Saewoon Hospital.

92
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,180
What are you saying?

93
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,270
Lee Chun Goo is the culprit.

94
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,790
What?

95
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,700
There's no way.

96
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,620
Lee Chun Goo doesn't match the profile
of the Gyeonggi Nambu killer.

97
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,430
Who cares about the profiling?
Just get over there now!

98
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,240
That can't be.

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,820
Lee Chun Goo was driving the bus
when Choi Young Shin got caught.

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,850
He can't be the killer and his age too...

101
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,170
<i>Lee Chun Goo is the culprit.</i>

102
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,700
That can't be.

103
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,700
Lee Chun Goo was driving the bus
when Choi Young Shin got caught.

104
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,250
He can't be the killer and his age too...

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,170
- How old was he?
- Huh?

106
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,070
Back when he got into the accident,
how old was Lee Chun Goo's son?

107
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,030
It was right after
he graduated high school.

108
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,200
So he was probably about 20 years old.

109
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,830
<i>His wife died when the boy was young,
so he raised him by himself.</i>

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
Chun Goo felt bad about
leaving him home alone.

111
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,910
He let him ride along
on the bus everyday.

112
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,400
He was very devoted to him.

113
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,740
I guess he had good memories of that.

114
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,470
Even when he got older, he would
ride it all day till the last stop.

115
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,590
I gave him rides a few times too.

116
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,010
He was a sick boy,
so he couldn't get a job.

117
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,110
And it didn't feel right
to leave him home all day.

118
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,450
So he rode the 95 bus all day?

119
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,330
The victims were all in different age
groups and had different jobs.

120
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,690
They all lived in different areas too.

121
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,710
They had only one thing in common.

122
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,370
<i>The all died while taking the bus home.</i>

123
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,390
<i>I put the locations of their deaths
into the Geopros program.</i>

124
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,730
<i>I got the result of a bus
that is currently running.</i>

125
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,080
<i>Bus 95.</i>

126
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,810
<i>All the victims rode that bus.</i>

127
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,080
<i>What if Lee Chun Goo isn't the killer?</i>

128
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,490
<i>[Name: Lee Jin Hyung
Guardian: Lee Chun Goo]</i>

129
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,070
<i>What if it was a lie?</i>

130
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,720
<i>What if Lee Chun Goo
had no choice but to lie?</i>

131
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,690
Leave now.

132
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,010
Hey!

133
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,420
Look, I think someone's fighting.

134
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,820
Jin Hyung, did something
happen out there?

135
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,790
No, nothing happened.

136
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,260
Goodbye.

137
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,170
Bye, Miss.

138
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,090
I'm so tired. I need to go home and rest.

139
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,430
- Get going.
- Bye.

140
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,580
Wait for me a bit.
Let's go home together.

141
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,320
I'll head home first.
See you there.

142
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,170
Min Joo...

143
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,180
<i>Chun Goo said this constantly.</i>

144
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,390
<i>"I would do anything for my son."</i>

145
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,880
You remember, right?
Someone ran onto the bus?

146
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,850
No one got on at that stop.

147
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,840
Sir, have you seen
a young woman by any chance?

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
Thank you, thank you.

149
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,990
Won Kyung!

150
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,800
Won Kyung!

151
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,230
No, no...

152
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,670
<i>[Park Hae Young]</i>

153
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,100
- It's me.
- <i>It's not Lee Chun Goo!</i>

154
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,030
<i>Lee Chun Goo most likely murdered
Jung Kyung Soon to destroy the evidence.</i>

155
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,150
<i>But the real Gyeonggi Nambu killer
is someone else.</i>

156
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,590
So who is it?

157
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,490
<i>Detective Cha Soo Hyun?</i>

158
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,840
Detective Cha?

159
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,660
Detective Cha, are you listening?
Detective Cha!

160
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,860
I can't get in touch with
Detective Cha Soo Hyun.

161
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,030
- Are you hurt?
- Are you all right?

162
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,410
What's going on?

163
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,630
Where's Lee Chun Goo?

164
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,640
Who is he?

165
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,930
It's him.

166
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,700
The Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer
isn't Lee Chun Goo. It's him.

167
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,140
I wasn't trying to kill you.

168
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,030
I opened my eyes and she had a gun.
That's why I did it.

169
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,030
No, Park Hae Young is right.

170
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,770
He's the killer.

171
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,810
It's not me!

172
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,290
Don't move, you punk!

173
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,680
Have you seen TV?

174
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,760
<i>The Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer
that put fear in the entire nation</i>

175
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,430
<i>has finally been arrested
by the police after 26 years.</i>

176
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,770
<i>Under the pressure
of the re-investigation</i>

177
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,800
<i>the criminal chose to turn himself in.</i>

178
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,760
<i>He was arrested by Gyeonggi Police
and is currently being questioned.</i>

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,130
I did it.

180
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,460
I killed Jung Kyung Soon.

181
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,420
I killed everyone 26 years ago.

182
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,200
Lee Chun Goo is not him.

183
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,520
He likely killed Jung Kyung Soon
and he knew he'd be caught

184
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,630
so he's taking responsibility
for his son's crimes.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,130
What about the son?
Has he confessed to his crimes?

186
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,930
No.

187
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,450
- What about other evidence?
- There's nothing conclusive.

188
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm sure you know how
the police organization works.

189
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,300
When it comes to cases
that gathers media attention

190
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,660
it isn't easy for the police to admit
that they arrested the wrong person.

191
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,340
That means the police
were fooled by the suspects.

192
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,490
Without evidence to overturn
Lee Chun Goo's confession

193
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,330
no one will believe what
the cold case squad team has to say.

194
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,840
Gosh, I worked hard for once.

195
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,200
It was all for nothing.

196
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,000
This case is over with now.

197
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,460
What are you doing?

198
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,390
I just feel stuffy.

199
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,070
<i>[Kim Won Kyung - Office Employee
November 7, 1989 9:30 p.m.]</i>

200
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,600
Detective.

201
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,910
<i>Are you listening?
It's me, Park Hae Young.</i>

202
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,550
<i>Are you listening, Detective?</i>

203
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,490
Yes, I'm listening.

204
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,690
What about the last victim?
What happened to her?

205
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,150
<i>Kim Won Kyung, the office worker.</i>

206
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,760
<i>Is she still alive?</i>

207
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,810
Have you caught the killer?

208
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,460
<i>You said it's 2015 there.</i>

209
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,060
Have you caught the killer?

210
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,520
Detective, what's wrong?

211
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,220
Something is wrong, isn't it?

212
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,040
I asked you if you've caught the killer.
Have you caught him?

213
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,710
Well, the thing is...

214
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,430
The bus driver, Lee Chun Goo...

215
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,620
<i>Is it him?</i>

216
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,870
Is it him? It is, isn't it?

217
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,050
- No, it isn't him. He's...
- <i>Then who is it!</i>

218
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,250
I will go and kill that person,
so tell me now!

219
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,370
Detective, why...

220
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,630
You've probably only seen pictures.

221
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,030
Just a few pictures.

222
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,920
Victims' names, jobs,
time of death, and location.

223
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,450
That's all you know about them,
but not me.

224
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,170
Sir, have you seen a young woman
by any chance?

225
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,790
- She has light skin and hair down to...
- Over there.

226
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,190
Won Kyung!

227
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,480
Where are you?

228
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,120
She was alive just days ago.

229
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
She comforted me.

230
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,190
Be strong.

231
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,400
She smiled at me and she was kind.

232
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,230
<i>She just lived her life diligently!</i>

233
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,650
Thank you, thank you.

234
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,970
Won Kyung...

235
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,190
Won Kyung...

236
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,100
I'm going to kill that crazy bastard.

237
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm going kill him just the same way.

238
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,370
I'll kill him with my own hands!

239
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,780
You can't do that, Detective.
Then you'll become just like him.

240
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,310
You'll become a criminal.

241
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,710
Detective, are you listening to me?

242
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,110
<i>We still have a chance.</i>

243
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,770
<i>Bus attendant Jung Kyung Soo
knew the killer.</i>

244
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,400
<i>You have to interrogate her.</i>

245
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,960
<i>Detective... Detective Lee Jae Han!</i>

246
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,100
Detective!

247
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,890
Jung Kyung Soon...

248
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,340
- Jung Kyung Soon?
- Yes.

249
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,490
Jung Kyung Soon was
threatening Lee Chun Goo.

250
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,150
I don't know what about.

251
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,860
I'm sure it is evidence proving
Lee Jin Hyung is the killer.

252
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,320
If we can find that,
we can expose him.

253
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,580
If there was something like that,
Gyeonggi district would've found it.

254
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,710
They would have gone through

255
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,530
the crime scene
and Lee Chun Goo's things.

256
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,230
Yes, even Lee Chun Goo went through
the house after killing her.

257
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,450
But he couldn't find it.

258
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,580
So it's not in that house,
it's at another location.

259
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,900
Where is that?

260
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,620
That's what we need to find out.

261
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,080
Gosh, seriously?

262
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,950
The statute of limitations on
the Gyeonggi Nambu case was in 2004.

263
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,490
Up until then, it was a source of money
she could use to blackmail Lee Chun Goo.

264
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,060
After that, she likely hid it somewhere.

265
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,370
But the statute of limitations
no longer exists.

266
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,100
<i>A statute of limitations will no longer
exist for violent crimes before 2000.</i>

267
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,250
<i>Investigations on cold cases
will no longer be prohibited.</i>

268
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,510
She saw the news about
the statute of limitations

269
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,420
and she felt it could be
a source of money again.

270
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,620
What's the first thing
she would have done?

271
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,440
She would check on the evidence
she used to blackmail him.

272
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,830
You're not actually going along
with this, are you?

273
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,230
The statute of limitations on this case
was lifted on October 1.

274
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,750
If we follow her tracks on that day,
we can find the evidence.

275
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,390
Hey, hello?

276
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,340
The Superintendent is going to present
the results of the investigation himself.

277
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,610
Why are you trying to mess that up?

278
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,790
The Chief is not supporting this,
so do we really have to?

279
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,330
Please, let's not do this.

280
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,930
Park Hae Young and I will check out
Jung Kyung Soon's house again.

281
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,950
You guys check out where she went
and her phone and card records.

282
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,670
- Okay.
- Just don't do it!

283
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,820
Don't do it! Don't!

284
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,790
Are you okay?

285
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,430
Your neck.

286
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,280
I'm embarrassed I got attacked by him.
Do you think I'd be okay?

287
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,820
You shouldn't have gone in there
to face a man alone.

288
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,860
If I'm choosy about facing men or women,
I need to turn in my badge now.

289
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,470
What did you find?

290
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,540
<i>I looked up her card
and phone records for October 1.</i>

291
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,390
<i>There's nothing that could be a lead.</i>

292
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,730
Are you sure you didn't overlook it?

293
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,000
<i>The card was over the limit and she
didn't talk to anyone on the phone.</i>

294
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,960
<i>If you don't trust me,
don't ask me to do it.</i>

295
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,850
She's unorganized
and has a lazy personality.

296
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,120
She's not a detailed person.

297
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,870
Be quiet and just dig in.

298
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,070
Do you always work like this?

299
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,380
Yeah, I'm always like this
when I don't have time.

300
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,750
It was cold on October 1.

301
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,220
It will be faster to look
at warmer clothing.

302
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,810
No matter how much clothes women have,
they have a few pieces they wear often.

303
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,970
Find the ones with worn out sleeves
or smell strongly of perfume.

304
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,050
I told you she is unorganized
and has a lazy personality.

305
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,850
<i>[Seoul - Sunyang]</i>

306
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,680
<i>She has a cousin that lives in Sunyang.</i>

307
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,540
<i>I checked the records.</i>

308
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,420
<i>She lived with her from 2002 to 2004.</i>

309
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
She came by suddenly a while ago.

310
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,820
Did she look for something while here?

311
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,170
I'm not sure.

312
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,390
She went into the storage
without even saying hello.

313
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,570
I assumed she went to get
the things she left behind.

314
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,350
- Is it this?
- Yes.

315
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,860
Did you touch this, by any chance?

316
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,640
No, why would I?

317
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,210
I am standing in from
Gyeonggi District Police Station.

318
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,090
The Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders
has been under a veil for 26 years.

319
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,610
Will the whole story be exposed today?

320
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:22,450
There will be a presentation on the
investigation by the Gyeonggi District.

321
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,190
The whole nation's eyes and ears
are focused on this room right now.

322
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,560
- Who are you?
- I'm with the police.

323
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,960
What is this?

324
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,110
What are you doing?

325
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,790
You're certain about this investigation?

327
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,960
The locations and the M.O. all matches
Lee Chun Goo's confession.

328
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,470
I'm certain that Lee Chun Goo
is the murderer.

329
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,620
Good work.

330
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,930
I will be starting the presentation
on the Gyeonggi Nambu investigation.

331
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,360
On October 20, the M.O. used to murder
Jung Kyung Soon was determined

332
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,820
to bear a resemblance to the Gyeonggi
Nambu case by our investigative team.

333
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,850
They used nearby CCTV,
fingerprints, and blood evidence

334
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,130
and found a suspect.

335
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,720
First, as the Superintendent responsible
for deterrence of such crimes

336
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,500
I would like to apologize to
the families of the victims.

337
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,890
Superintendent.

338
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,390
What is that?

339
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,090
<i>[DNA Results]</i>
Did you find out something new?

340
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,770
- Can you continue?
- What is it you're looking at?

341
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,230
Is there some confusion?

342
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,960
The citizens are very interested.
Please tell us.

343
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,470
- What is it?
- Can you tell us?

344
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,900
Is it something you can't share?

345
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,080
While we were in the process of
investigating Jung Kyung Soon's murder

346
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,540
we were successful in finding
the Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer.

347
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,560
Are you certain Lee Chun Soo
is the culprit?

348
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,650
- Is there evidence?
- What's his motive?

349
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,960
Is there an accomplice?

350
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,510
- Can you elaborate on the motive?
- As for the presentation...

351
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,770
I'll hand it over to the lead detective.

352
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,060
Detective Cha Soo Hyun of cold case squad
at Seoul Metropolitan Police.

353
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,880
I assume you're prepared.

354
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,270
What's going on here?

355
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,450
My cold case squad discovered
Jung Kyung Soon on October 20.

356
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,070
During our investigation...

357
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,000
we found conclusive evidence that led us

358
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,600
to arrest the Gyeonggi Nambu
serial killer.

359
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,820
When you were questioned
at the police station...

360
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,650
that was when it started, wasn't it?

361
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,290
Lee Chun Woo?

362
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,850
You drove the bus that Hwang Min Joo
worked on that night, right?

363
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,990
Yes, I did.

364
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,410
Did anyone get on at the Hyunpoong stop?

365
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,780
He was in a black jacket
and in his early to mid-20s.

366
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,910
You remember, right?

367
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,160
Thank you for your help.

368
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,510
Yes.

369
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,290
By the way...

370
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,290
If it's a black jacket and early 20s...

371
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,690
that sounds a lot like Jin Hyung.

372
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,580
I need to go home and rest.

373
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,640
- Get going now.
- Yes, bye.

374
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,980
<i>He was on the bus that day.</i>

375
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,370
Which stop did Jin Hyung get on that day?

376
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,110
He was on it from the beginning.

377
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,410
Over there.

378
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,660
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,090
Won Kyung!

380
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,660
Jung Kyung Soon had stored away
this piece of evidence.

381
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,140
It has the fingerprints and blood of
the last Gyeonggi Nambu victim.

382
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,590
Also, it holds the DNA of the killer.

383
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,320
The killer who was arrested
with this piece of evidence

384
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,540
was paralyzed from
the waist down 26 years ago.

385
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,130
He was a patient in a medical facility
and is the son of Lee Chun Goo.

386
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,640
His name is Lee Jin Hyung.

387
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,830
<i>My son didn't do it.</i>

388
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,430
<i>My son isn't like that.</i>

389
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,910
My poor son.

390
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,440
He grew up so lonely without his mother.

391
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,250
You really are something.

392
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,410
First victim, college student
Chae Eun Young.

393
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,600
Second victim, mother of two,
Park Soon Hee.

394
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,260
Third, Kim Yoon Joo who was
about to get married.

395
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,580
Fourth, Kim Mal Soon who died
a day before her birthday.

396
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,320
Look at them straight on.

397
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,240
You're not the only one
with family precious to you.

398
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,110
They have family that's
precious to them too.

399
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,700
Do you really feel nothing for them?

400
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,310
You should feel sorry to them!

401
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,590
You don't know anything.

402
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,030
Don't speak that way
when you don't know anything!

403
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,230
My poor son...
He's already paid for his crimes.

404
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,550
He paid for his crimes back then!

405
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,290
Oh my! Why? Why are you doing this?

406
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,870
No, no. You can't! No.

407
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,930
You...

408
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,380
No, no, no!

409
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,270
No!

410
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,780
Hey.

411
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,220
Hey!

412
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,130
Get over here.

413
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,990
Hey!

414
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,180
Why did you do it? Why!

415
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,020
Why did you do it?
Why, why, why, why!

416
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,090
Why did you do it?
Why, why, why, why...

417
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,610
So, that's why...

418
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,490
You lied because he's your son?

419
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,900
That no one got on the bus?

420
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,700
My son didn't do it.

421
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,010
No one got on the bus.

422
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,930
If you had answered the question
properly back then...

423
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,470
She wouldn't have died.
She would be alive now.

424
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,270
I don't know what you're talking about.
My son didn't do it!

425
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,420
Please, just stop it!

426
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,230
This isn't over.

427
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,970
He will kill again.

428
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,200
He will murder again!

429
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
But...

430
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,890
There's no one left from the bus.

431
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,030
I'm the only one left.

432
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,150
Even if you put a knife to my throat,
my son didn't do it!

433
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,510
Is that right?

434
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,780
Even with a knife to your throat,
you can't do it.

435
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,830
Then I have no choice.

436
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,370
I have no evidence.

437
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,340
I have no witnesses.

438
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,590
I'll to end with my own hands. Right?

439
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,580
No, you can't!

440
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,900
Let go of me!

441
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,380
Jin Hyung!

442
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,720
No! Jin Hyung!

443
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,420
<i>That crazy man dropped my son.</i>

444
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,170
What more punishment must he take?

445
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,090
That crazy man?

446
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,520
Detective Lee Jae Han stopped it?

447
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,360
Stopped the murders?

448
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,430
My legs... what's wrong with them?

449
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,100
It's okay, Jin Hyung.

450
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,660
My legs, my legs, my legs!

451
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,620
My legs!

452
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,130
My legs, no!

453
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,530
Leave and don't come back.

454
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,250
I heard what you told the doctor.

455
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,070
That your son tripped backwards and fell.

456
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,180
I'm going to go.

457
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,550
And I'm turning myself in
for what I did to your son.

458
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:53,270
So get your son to turn
himself in as well.

459
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,090
I don't know what you're saying.

460
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,960
Neither my son or you have anything
to turn yourselves into the police for.

461
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,590
My son just tripped backwards and fell.

462
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,850
You weren't even there.

463
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,940
Are you going to hide this
until the very end?

464
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,200
My son has suffered enough.
Can't you see that?

465
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,160
He is paralyzed from the waist down.
He will be bedridden for his whole life.

466
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,570
Think of what your son has done.

467
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,120
At the very least,
the victims' families deserve to know.

468
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,660
Get him to turn himself in.

469
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,400
My son is just a poor boy
without a mother.

470
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,160
Now he will become even more pitiful.

471
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,900
I can't make his life
even more miserable.

472
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,190
Leave!

473
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,240
We have suffered enough misery.

474
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,300

investigating again

everyone could forget it and live.

477

Why, why?

478

What if Detective Lee Jae Han
had killed your son that day?

479
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,430
Would you be able to forget?

480
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,700
As if nothing happened?

481
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,420
