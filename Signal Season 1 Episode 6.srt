00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,720
What happened on that day?

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,050
Detective, it's me, Park Hae Young.

6
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,150
Detective, are you listening?

7
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,140
What happened?

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,480
The past has changed
with the burglary case.

9
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,070
<i>Is Oh Kyung Tae actually guilty?</i>

10
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,070
Lieutenant...

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,540
Detective, Oh Kyung Tae
has kidnapped someone.

12
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,830
He's going to kill that person.

13
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,910
<i>Exactly what happened that day?</i>

14
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,200
We were wrong.

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,310
No, no... I was...

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,310
I did everything wrong.

17
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,520
<i>Everything...</i>

18
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,160
<i>is ruined because of me.</i>

19
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,000
These transmissions...

20
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,510
should never have started.

21
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,050
What are you saying?

22
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,420
Here.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,220
Was it him?

24
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,530
Hold on.

25
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,280
Actually, it wasn't him.

26
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,420
It was this person.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
This person?

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,370
Yes, that's the guy.

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,360
Really?

30
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,490
He really said it was Oh Kyung Tae?

31
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah, that's right.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,490
I looked for fingerprints where
you told me to, Detective Lee.

33
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,950
I found some prints on
Han Suk Hee's mailbox.

34
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,610
<i>[Fingerprint Test Results]</i>

35
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,450
<i>[Sample 1 and Sample 2,
99.98 percent match]</i>

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,690
Why are you doing this?

37
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
Why did you lie?

38
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,580
Lie about what? It's not me!

39
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,560
A witness came forward
and identified you.

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,030
Your fingerprints were found
at that house.

41
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,110
None of that is what happened.

42
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,330
Your car...

43
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,950
Where did you get the money?

44
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,930
Do you really not trust me at all?

45
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,980
I bought that for Eun Ji's future.

46
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,020
You think I'd buy that with stolen money?

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
What are you doing here?

48
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,690
Dad really didn't do it.

49
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,450
Let's go in quietly.

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm telling you that
Dad really didn't do it.

51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,650
Detective Lee, let me
just take Eun Ji home.

52
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,350
Then I'll go in on my own, okay?

53
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,540
There are probably detectives
waiting for you at home.

54
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,960
Come with me.

55
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,160
Eun Ji, go home and wait for me.

56
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,220
You trust your dad, right?

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,290
I'll be back soon so go home.

58
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,670
Let's go.

59
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,410
If both you and Mom diet,
am I supposed to starve?

60
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
Should I also eat vegetables
all the time?

61
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,080
Come on. Let's get on.

62
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,950
Hurry up and get on.

63
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,020
You were with your daughter during
the Hanyoung Bridge accident?

64
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes, I was there with my daughter.

65
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,640
But what does that have to do
with my daughter's kidnapping?

66
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,470
I looked into Oh Kyung Tae's
personal information.

67
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh Kyung Tae's daughter also died
from the Hanyoung Bridge accident.

68
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,320
And what of it?
Many people died from that accident.

69
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,230
He may have taken your daughter
to demand a ransom.

70
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,880
We should still look into
all other possibilities.

71
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,650
It helps us to know more
about your daughter.

72
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,940
Yeo Jin came back from
the brink of death back then.

73
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,600
She has suffered
ever since that incident.

74
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,860
It was a horrible day,
and we wanted to forget it.

75
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,170
Okay. Keep your composure.

76
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,450
Wait.

77
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,820
Slowly, slowly.

78
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,200
Hello.

79
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,160
Dad... Dad?

80
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,040
Yeo Jin! Where are you?

81
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,100
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

82
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,920
What's going on?

83
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,390
We narrowed down the ares that
Shin Yeo Jin would likely be in.

84
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,960
It's very likely that
she's in one of these areas.

85
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,040
The victim has made contact.
Her cell phone is turned on.

86
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
What?

87
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,270
Is she okay?

88
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,100
Are you alone? Are you okay?

89
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,040
<i>I am... alone.</i>

90
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,860
<i>Dad... I'm so cold.</i>

91
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,220
Shin Yeo Jin.
Please keep calm and listen to me.

92
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm Cha Soo Hyun of
the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

93
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,880
What do you see in your surroundings?

94
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,790
It's a car. I'm inside a car.

95
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,750
<i>Are you inside a trunk?</i>

96
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,350
No.

97
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,000
It's very big.

98
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,380
How about windows?

99
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,870
There are no windows.

100
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,940
Everything is closed off.

101
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,650
It's just so cold.

102
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,950
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.

103
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeo Jin!

104
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,300
What about GPS location?

105
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,970
It's within three kilometers of here.

106
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,290
If it's within three kilometers,
that is this area here.

107
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,640
Look through every
refrigerated truck in this area.

108
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,770
Okay, I got it.

109
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,350
Refrigerated trucks! Let's go.

110
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,350
Everyone get going except one.
Detective Park, you stay behind.

111
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,700
- Okay.
- What are you doing? Get going.

112
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,240
Isn't this strange?

113
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,430
Why would he leave the phone
behind for Shin Yeo Jin?

114
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,100
He could have dropped it by mistake.
That happens a lot.

115
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,370
I heard that Oh Kyung Tae
was very detailed.

116
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,190
We confirmed that it was Shin Yeo Jin.
It was definitely her that called.

117
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,480
We have to save the victim's life
first and foremost.

118
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,270
Detective Choi, get ready to go.

119
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,430
<i>[Park Hae Young]</i>

120
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,820
- It's me.
- <i>Shin Yeo Jin is not the target.</i>

121
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,980
What do you mean?

122
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,880
Oh Kyung Tae and Shin Dong Woon's
daughters were both

123
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,380
in the Hanyoung Bridge accident.

124
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,180
- <i>I know.</i>
- It wasn't just a normal accident.

125
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,750
Oh Kyung Tae's daughter
could have been saved.

126
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,550
Yeo Jin... Yeo Jin!

127
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,110
Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin!

128
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,770
Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin!

129
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,890
Yeo Jin. Yeo Jin!

130
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,880
Hey, hey! Are you all right?

131
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,140
Hey!

132
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,270
No, no, no, no...

133
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,520
No, no, no!

134
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
No...

135
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,940
Eun Ji!

136
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,160
Eun Ji. What's going on?

137
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,880
Eun Ji. Hey!

138
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,930
Hey, Eun Ji!

139
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,500
Eun Ji!

140
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,340
Please help me!

141
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,500
Save my daughter, please!

142
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,760
You have to save my daughter here.

143
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,610
My daughter is in there.

144
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,180
Hey, bring that over here.

145
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,270
My daughter is in there. Save her.

146
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,420
- Someone needs help here.
- Eun Ji!

147
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,800
Eun Ji!

148
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,310
- Hey, check the chart.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,050
Is her leg stuck?

150
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,600
Isn't this the smell of gas?

151
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,270
- Please help her over here!
- Bring the hydraulic jack now!

152
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,100
- Eun Ji!
- Why is there only one?

153
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,660
We only have one right now.

154
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,090
When will the second jack get here?

155
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,070
Hold on just a bit, Eun Ji.
I'll get to you soon.

156
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,240
<i>There are two female students
stuck in the bus.</i>

157
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,000
<i>The gas is leaking. We have no time!</i>

158
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,180
Send it over as soon as possible.
The childrens' lives are in danger!

159
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,510
- Just pick one.
- <i>You have to save one of them.</i>

160
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,760
<i>What if there is an explosion?</i>

161
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,350
We could get hurt if there is a spark.
We must decide now.

162
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,520
Eun Ji!

163
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,670
Are you going to take responsibility
if my daughter dies?

164
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,220
<i>Do it quick! Now!</i>

165
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,260
Set it up on this side.

166
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,460
No! Eun Ji!

167
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,550
Eun Ji.

168
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,900
Hurry.

169
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,630
Eun Ji, Eun Ji!

170
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,620
Eun Ji!

171
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,430
We have to hurry up.

172
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,710
No, you can't!

173
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,340
You have to move fast. It's dangerous!

174
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,570
You can't! No.

175
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,620
No!

176
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,010
No, Eun Ji...

177
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,600
Eun Ji!

178
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,290
No...

179
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,580
No, no!

180
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,830
Eun Ji.

181
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,500
Eun Ji...

182
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,220
Eun Ji!

183
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,440
<i>Oh Kyung Tae believes that
Shin Dong Woon killed his daughter.</i>

184
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,170
How did you find that out? Who told you?

185
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,800
I heard from a witness
who saw the accident himself.

186
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,270
Who is this witness?

187
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,250
That's not the important part.

188
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,270
<i>Oh Kyung Tae's past crimes
were meticulous and efficient.</i>

189
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,280
If he wanted to kill Shin Yeo Jin,
who lived instead of his daughter

190
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,870
<i>he would have killed her on the spot,
not abducted her.</i>

191
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,880
<i>Since that's more efficient.</i>

192
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,460
But he took her,
and even exposed himself.

193
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,240
<i>Just like he couldn't do anything
to save his own dying daughter</i>

194
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,810
<i>he's doing the same thing
to Shin Dong Woon.</i>

195
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,900
Shin Yeo Jin is just the bait.

196
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,440
Oh Kyung Tae's true target
is Shin Dong Woon.

197
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,830
Shin Yeo Jin is likely somewhere
near Hanyoung Bridge.

198
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,570
<i>The kidnapping was triggered
by a long-standing resentment.</i>

199
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>It makes sense to return
to a symbolic place.</i>

200
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,970
<i>Hello? Detective Cha?</i>

201
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,420
He didn't drop her phone.

202
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,790
He left it there on purpose.

203
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,790
In order to fool us.

204
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,620
<i>You don't see Shin Dong Woon?</i>

205
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,760
He was here just a minute ago.

206
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,120
But... gosh.

207
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,150
<i>It's my fault.</i>

208
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,340
Oh Kyung Tae...

209
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,780
was not the culprit.

210
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,090
What do you mean?

211
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,120
Hey!

212
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,110
Yeah? Hey, what's your problem?

213
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,500
I heard there were no prints.

214
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,250
I heard you only found partial prints.

215
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,160
I heard you couldn't even
verify whose they were.

216
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,530
I had a witness.

217
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,710
The witness only got
a passing glance at night.

218
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,940
If there were no prints,
I wouldn't have to arrest him!

219
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,240
What do you expect me to do?

220
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,610
The bosses wanted us to catch the guy!

221
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,020
You must be completely crazy.

222
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,950
Hey, we had a witness.

223
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,680
He said it was Oh Kyung Tae for sure.

224
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm going to reveal everything!

225
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,780
Oh Kyung Tae's been convicted already.

226
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,730
No one within the police
is going to believe you.

227
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,650
It's your fault.

228
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,470
It's your fault, you bastard!

229
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,590
If you hadn't arrested me...

230
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,730
If I had been by her side,
I could have saved her life.

231
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,650
It's all your fault!

232
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,300
You were right about what you said.

233
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,650
This case...

234
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,920
It should have remained unsolved.

235
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,150
I should have left it alone.

236
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,550
<i>Fine the real culprit.</i>

237
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,630
<i>We ruined everything, so we have
to put things back in place.</i>

238
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,940
<i>If you can find who did it now,
you can make things right.</i>

239
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,010
<i>It's my fault. I have to stop it.</i>

240
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,450
Shin Dong Woon's cell phone turned off.
We can't locate him.

241
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,810
Why do you need to?

242
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>Shin Dong Woon has disappeared.
Get me some backup.</i>

243
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,750
How can I ask for backup
when I don't know where he is?

244
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,240
- He's likely near Hanyoung Bridge.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

245
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,380
Get me backup in
the Hanyoung Bridge area.

246
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,940
<i>Hanyoung Bridge at 12:00 a.m.</i>

247
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,900
<i>If you bring the police,
the temperature goes to minus 50 Celsius.</i>

248
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,740
<i>Then you're daughter will die.</i>

249
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,980
<i>If you want to save your daughter,
you make the decision.</i>

250
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,730
Where is my Yeo Jin? Where is she?

251
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,900
How does it feel seeing
your daughter dying?

252
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,300
Why are you doing this this us? Why?

253
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,710
You did it too.
Right here on the Hanyoung Bridge.

254
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,150
Are you going to take responsibility
if my daughter dies?

255
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,870
I want you too see
exactly how it feels.

256
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,740
Your daughter is dying...

257
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,280
That feeling of being
completely helpless...

258
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,270
What are you talking about?

259
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,470
I was watching rats dying in the truck.

260
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,620
I set it for minus 20 degree Celsius.

261
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,660
It hadn't even been five minutes
and they froze to death.

262
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,390
A rat takes five minutes to die.

263
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,320
How long do you think a person can last?

264
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,640
Please.  Please let my daughter live.

265
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,500
I was in the wrong.
Just let my daughter live, please.

266
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Please!

267
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,370
This isn't the time for that.

268
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,700
You should go save your daughter,
shouldn't you?

269
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
It has to be around here somewhere.

270
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,700
Oh Kyung Tae, where is Shin Yeo Jin?

271
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,410
Where is Shin Yeo Jin?

272
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Eun Ji.

273
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,850
You've waited a long time, haven't you?

274
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,660
<i>[Park Hae Young]</i>

275
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,660
Did you find it?

276
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,930
There's a truck in front of the Memorial
Tower at south end of Hanyoung Bridge.

277
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,510
Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin!

278
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,250
It's Dad. Open up, Yeo Jin!

279
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,380
Yeo Jin!

280
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,530
Yeo Jin, answer me!

281
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,330
Oh Kyung Tae.

282
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,810
You have the right to remain silent.

283
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,340
You have the right to legal counsel.

284
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,000
It's too short.

285
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,950
Compared to my 20 years.

286
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,700
It's too short for you.

287
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,560
He tried to escape a few times,
but he failed.

288
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,590
He was quiet after that.

289
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,010
<i>He learned some electronics skills too,
and didn't cause trouble.</i>

290
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,240
Police! Step aside.

291
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,880
It's locked and it won't open.
There's no answer either.

292
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,930
<i>Yeo Jin.</i>

293
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,160
<i>Electronic skills...</i>

294
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,650
<i>The refrigeration in the trucks
uses liquid petroleum gas.</i>

295
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,790
<i>That's why he learned
the electronic skills.</i>

296
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,830
<i>He's going to use it kill him with fire
just like his daughter.</i>

297
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,730
Yeo Jin!

298
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,140
Please move. It's dangerous.

299
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,270
Yeo Jin.

300
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,500
- Yeo Jin.
- Move back.

301
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,120
Don't come any closer.

302
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,250
Yeo Jin.

303
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,640
Yeo Jin.

304
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,550
Detective Cha, you can't!

305
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,370
She's here.

306
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,170
She's here. We found her!

307
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,150
No!

308
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,430
Move!

309
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,940
No!

310
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,820
What is this about?

311
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,630
What are you saying happened to Soo Hyun?
It's not true, right? Right?

312
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,150
It's not true, is it? Is it?

313
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,020
I'm sorry.

314
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,360
What are you trying to say...

315
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,130
Where's my Soo Hyun?

316
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,290
Mom.

317
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,970
Soo Hyun!

318
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,820
Soo Hyun, your mom is here!

319
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,410
Soo Hyun, Mom is here.

320
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,590
Soo Hyun...

321
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,720
Mom is here.

322
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,060
Soo Hyun, come here.

323
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,780
Soo Hyun!

324
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,160
Soo Hyun, come to Mom.

325
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,750
Soo Hyun!

326
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,640
Soo Hyun.

327
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,480
<i>We were wrong.</i>

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,210
There were tons of cops here that night,
but no one got a look at him.

484
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,420
I told you it's correct. Okay?

485
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,130
Hey.

486
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,690
You said it was the window
on the opposite side back then.

487
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,280
How much of it is a lie?

488
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,980
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- No one was ever there, right?

489
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,290
If there was someone,
there's no way he could have escaped.

490
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,070
Why did you lie!

491
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,570
I have nothing to say so get lost.

492
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,000
Then was it you who did it?

493
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,200
What are you doing?

494
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,130
You can't be doing this here.

495
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,900
<i>It's the work of an amateur.</i>

496
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,410
<i>Think about it.</i>

497
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,400
<i>Why would a pro make things
into such a big debacle?</i>

498
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,060
There's no point in
aggravating detectives

499
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,710
and losing their source of income.

500
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,600
I heard you haven't even
found the stolen items.

501
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,730
This isn't someone being careful.
This person doesn't know the route.

502
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,070
The work is definitely an amateur,
but it's too easy.

503
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,340
These are incredibly rich households.
The security would be quite something.

504
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,300
He got in too easy.

505
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,830
Do you think it's someone they know?

506
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,130
It's me.

507
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,190
<i>An amateur that can enter easily.</i>

508
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,750
<i>And he wouldn't get suspected by anyone.</i>

509
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,420
<i>It's him. He's the one who did it.</i>

510
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,660
Where the heck is Lee Jae Han!

511
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,110
You punk! You...

512
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,180
Are you crazy?

513
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,830
Why would you crawl over there?

514
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,830
- Crawl where? I walked!
- Is this a joke to you?

515
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,000
Chief, are you the one
joking around with me?

516
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,120
What do you mean?

517
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,470
We're just simple-minded men
who run where we're told to go.

518
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,400
So we might not have known.

519
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,060
But you knew, didn't you?

520
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,780
Chief, you knew where the Task Force,
precinct, and street officers were.

521
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,590
You knew where they were all staked out
and which way they were running!

522
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,480
Here.

523
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,450
Take a look.

524
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,130
If the culprit had been out that night,
there was nowhere for him to escape.

525
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,730
So why is it that we couldn't catch him?

526
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,240
There was no one to catch
in the first place, right?

527
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,030
The fourth victim, Han Se Kyu,
was lying from the beginning.

528
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,440
He made up a thief.

529
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,240
He lied to us that he ran "that way".

530
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,620
The culprit is caught
and this case is over with.

531
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,480
The lead that got you that arrest
came from Han Se Kyu.

532
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,480
If he was lying from the start,
we should reinvestigate!

533
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,940
Han Se Kyu is the son
of the Head Prosecutor.

534
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,670
Why would he lie?

535
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,350
So does that mean...

536
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:37,100
he's born with a lie detector
attached to his mouth?

537
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,990
Don't do this so early in the morning.
It's giving me an ulcer.

538
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,640
Get me a warrant.

539
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,370
If I dig around him,
I will find something.

540
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,720
If Han Se Kyu's testimony was perjury,
this needs be overturned.

541
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,270
Are you selling pancakes?
Overturn what?

542
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,810
Overturn what?

543
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,430
The Precinct Chief's job was on the line,
and he barely got it back.

544
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,220
I'm sure the higher-up
would really overturn it.

545
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,920
Stop calling attention
to yourself and just lay low.

546
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,380
Chief!

547
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,590
It's dirty and you feel screwed.

548
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:12,400
Every person is on a different level.
Do you know that?

549
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,270
What Han Se Kyu said is the truth.

550
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,650
What Oh Kyung Tae said is like bullshit.

551
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,810
So...

552
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,690
You want me to shut my mouth
and watch what I'm doing?

553
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,810
With this screwed up situation?

554
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,940
If you really want to overturn it,
find actual evidence.

555
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,580
Unless you have irrefutable evidence,
you'll never get an arrest warrant.

556
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,340
Wow, what a beautiful world it is.

557
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,360
Right? It's a beautiful world.

558
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,000
It's a really beautiful world!

559
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,630
Oh Kyung Tae refuses to see you.

560
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,590
I only need a moment.

561
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,470
He's very determined about it,
so we can't do anything.

562
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,690
Okay.

563
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,210
<i>Detective Lee Jae Han, are you listening?</i>

564
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,900
Yes, it's me. What happened?

565
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,130
What happened with Kyung Tae?

566
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,090
He killed a person.

567
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,630
<i>A cop has died.</i>

568
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,090
What about the larceny case?
Have you found who really did it?

569
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,150
I've found a suspect, but that's it.

570
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,580
I can't even get a glimpse of a warrant.

571
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,260
It won't be possible to find evidence
around the suspect.

572
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,590
By any chance, is your suspect
Han Se Kyu, the witness?

573
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,270
How did you know that?

574
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,480
I read Han Se Kyu's testimony
and some parts were off.

575
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,450
First, he said it was another man.

576
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,590
But then he changed it
to Oh Kyung Tae in the end.

577
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,780
In cases like this,
victims are usually traumatized

578
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,110
they have trouble remembering
the criminal's face accurately.

579
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,960
But Han Se Kyu was certain
he knew Oh Kyung Tae.

580
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,780
<i>Also, the photo the detectives
showed him was over ten years old.</i>

581
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,350
Han Se Kyu was still able to pick out
his picture from his mid-30s.

582
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,580
So the testimony became more mysterious.

583
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,860
So...

584
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,560
Han Se Kyu already knew
Oh Kyung Tae before the incident.

585
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,560
He had targeted him.

586
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,370
He was an ex-convict and a truck driver.

587
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,170
He couldn't have known Han Se Kyu.

588
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,460
I don't know how they knew each other.

589
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,770
But I'm sure Han Se Kyu
knew Oh Kyung Tae.

590
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,800
<i>If we can find out how they met</i>

591
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,110
<i>we should be able to find out
what Han Se Kyu is hiding.</i>

592
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,800
Oh Kyung Tae won't meet with me.

593
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,980
He refuses.

594
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,880
He won't ever want to see me. Ever...

595
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,870
Then I will find out.

596
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,250
Though it has been twenty years,
Oh Kyung Tae does exist here.

597
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,460
<i>What you must do is look
for evidence there, Detective.</i>

598
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,430
<i>The stolen goods that disappeared then
still haven't been discovered.</i>

599
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,900
<i>That means they didn't
steal it for the money.</i>

600
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,580
<i>If you can find those items,
that will be the evidence you need.</i>

601
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,190
I will find them.

602
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,400
I have to find them.

603
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,920
Lieutenant.

604
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,390
Please persuade Kyung Tae. You have to.

605
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:01,060
Detective, you have to solve the case.

606
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,300
I'm asking you.

607
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,940
So, how do you feel?

608
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,750
You must feel bittersweet.

609
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,120
You planned this for 20 years
and it still failed in the end.

610
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,350
Shin Dong Woon must be shedding tears
with his daughter right about now.

611
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,190
And feeling happy.

612
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,600
If you say his name one more time...

613
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,720
I'll kill you first.

614
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,590
No, you got it all wrong to begin with.

615
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,080
Shin Dong Woon was just a victim too.

616
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,000
A victim?

617
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,170
My daughter died at his hands!

618
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:17,630
If you were in his place,
you would've done the same thing.

619
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,580
It's not Shin Dong Woon.

620
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,070
If you wanted revenge,
you should've done it properly.

621
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,550
The ones who built a bridge like that...

622
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,090
You should've gone after the ones
who lied that the bridge was safe.

623
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:32,590
Why? Were you afraid to get
revenge on stronger people?

624
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,600
The CEO of the construction company.

625
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,960
The government officials
that sit way above us.

626
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,670
What do you know to mouth off?

627
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,670
What do you cops know!

628
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:41,690
That's right.

629
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:45,360
I know all about how incompetent
and useless the police are.

630
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,940
I've experienced as much as you...

631
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:50,090
No, I've felt it more painfully than you.

632
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,800
But at the very least,
the cop you killed wasn't like that.

633
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:59,100
You killed the one cop who
would have understood you!

634
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,440
Someone who would understand me?

635
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,280
No one in this world...

636
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,010
would understand me.

637
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,730
The real one is still left.

638
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,400
Your daughter, Eun Ji...

639
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,090
When your daughter, Eun Ji, was dying...

640
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,300
the person who kept you
from being able to do anything.

641
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,110
The person who manipulated
the police and framed you.

642
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,050
You need to punish him.

643
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,050
That is true revenge.

644
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,730
The person who ought to punished
is probably living well and happy.

645
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:54,020
He must pay for the crimes
that committed now.

646
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,690
I will help you.

647
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:01,590
If you cooperate with me,
we can catch him.

648
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,160
No...

649
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,030
Help me.

650
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,220
We have to get him.

<i>[Gaesu-dong Larceny Case]</i>

652
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,530
Can you undo the handcuffs?

653
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,100
I'm going to try to revive
your memory of 20 years ago.

654
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:49,160
The clue will be somewhere in September
of 1995 when the burglaries occurred.

655
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,980
Let's start with
September 1 of that year.

656
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,010
Anything involving that day
would be helpful.

657
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,840
Tell me anything that you remember.

658
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,800
I don't remember anything.

659
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,560
Let's start in the morning.

660
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,520
The weather that day
was three degrees Celsius.

661
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,240
It was a clear day with a cold wind.

662
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,920
Anything would be good.

663
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,550
Think slowly about your memories.

664
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,910
- Please enjoy.
- Yes.

665
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,500
- So...
- Jae Han.

666
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,160
Doesn't this come with sliced beef?

667
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,360
Since when did you eat that?

668
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,370
All right, all right. Order it.

669
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,690
- Ma'am, one order of sliced beef.
- Yes.

670
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,300
So, you haven't seen
any of these stolen items?

671
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,630
I know it hasn't made its way into China.

672
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,010
No one I know on the streets
has bought them either.

673
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,970
You're sure?

674
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,410
If they were on the streets,
I bet the cops would know first.

675
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,510
It was such big news.

676
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,040
<i>If it's not in the markets,
they still have the goods.</i>

677
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,960
<i>Where are they hiding it?</i>

678
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,440
<i>It wouldn't be in at their home.
It would be exposed to too many people.</i>

679
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,410
<i>Cottage, Gyeonggi-do, Mikang Daeseon.</i>

<i>Under Han Se Kyu father's name,

682
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,190
I just need to take a quick look.

683
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:55,500
Just because you're the police,
can you search people's homes like this?

684
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,050
Get out of here!

685
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,400
Hello. This is the police, right?

686
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,230
Some weird person came in
and is searching through things.

687
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,600
I think you should come.

688
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,360
Hey, what are you doing
without a warrant?

689
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,720
I called the police, just so you know.

690
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,950
Yes, I'm leaving. I'm going.

<i>Jinsung Bank, Han Se Kyu's personal bank

692
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,650
Han Se Kyu has not put any items

693
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:30,430
in the safety deposit box
in the past six months.

694
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,060
Did you make sure of that?

695
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,560
I made sure and checked.

696
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,150
And stop asking me for these favors.

697
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,550

September 10 was a Sunday.

706
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,980
What did you usually do on Sundays?

707
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:44,360
You said you were working in Incheon
on the 9th for Thanksgiving.

708
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,490
Then did you rest on September 10?

709
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,730
Did you go anywhere?

710
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:55,400
I probably worked the day after
Thanksgiving too.

711
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,200
That's the busiest day for deliveries,
so there's no time to rest.

712
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,580
Where did you go to deliver?

713
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,150
You probably went to pick up
delivery items in the morning.

714
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,660
What did you pick up?

715
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:21,380
Since it was Thanksgiving,
maybe fruit or fish?

716
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,090
Or something like meat...

717
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,620
It was fish.

718
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,900
I delivered fish that day.

719
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,590
Gaesu-dong. I went to Gaesu-dong.

720
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,970
Gaesu-dong?

721
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,730
Who are you?

722
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,070
Oh, hi.

723
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,550
Gosh, so dirty!

724
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,940
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

725
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,280
Move your dirty hand.

726
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,030
So dirty. It stinks.

727
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,820
Just get lost.

728
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,660
It's me. Open up.

729
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,440
That can't be why...

730
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,950
Is that why he pointed at
Kyung Tae as the culprit?

731
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,590
<i>He knew his face from that day.</i>

732
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:49,900
He lied in his testimony
that he saw Kyung Tae.

733
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,830
As long as it wasn't him...

734
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,610
He didn't care who it was,
that dog.

735
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,670
What about the stolen good?
Have you found them?

736
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,460
Stolen goods?
Evidence, evidence, evidence...

737
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,700

738
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,050
Is it the same over there?

739
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,650
If you have money and power...

740
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,380
can you live happily and well
no matter what awful thing you do?

741
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,560
Don't forget about
that case from last time.

742
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,420
It's been 20 years.

743
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,860
Something must have changed, right?

744
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,810
Yes... it's different.

745
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,750
It's different from back then.

746
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,980
We can make it that way.

747
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,260
There will be a hint in
Oh Kyung Tae's testimony.

748
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,380
You have to catch this guy,
Detective Lee Jae Han.

749
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,730
I can't do it from here.

750
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,380
What color did you say his car was again?

751
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,020
Red, why?

752
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,320
I think I can catch him.

753
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,230
