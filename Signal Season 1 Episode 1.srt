<i>Episode 1</i>

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,450
<i>[July 29, 2000]</i>

4
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,710
<i>Hey, wait for me.</i>

5
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,570
<i>Bye! See you tomorrow.</i>

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,440
It's raining!

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,530
<i>Breaking news.</i>

8
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,330
<i>A primary school student was kidnapped
on her way home from school in Gyeonggi.</i>

9
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,220
<i>Police have started an investigation.</i>

10
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,030
<i>[Name: Kim Yoon Jung
Age: 11]</i>

11
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,190
What was Yoon Jung like?

12
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you know Yoon Jung?

13
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,530
Was Yoon Jung your friend?

14
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,960
What are your thoughts on
the Kim Yoon Jung abduction?

15
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,420
<i>A key suspect has been found
in the Kim Yoon Jung case.</i>

16
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,090
<i>A blackmail letter, as well fingerprint,
were found belonging to Seo Hyung Joon.</i>

17
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,090
<i>He is currently enrolled in
Sangjin University Medical School.</i>

18
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,490
<i>But Yoon Jung was taken by a woman.</i>

19
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,350
Mister.

20
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,330
- It's not that him. It's not a man.
- What's he saying?

21
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,000
The kidnapper is not a man.

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,790
<i>Have you heard from
the credit card company?</i>

23
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,230
<i>I gave the call logs to him already.</i>

24
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>- Anything new on the Yoon Jung case?
- Not yet.</i>

25
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,740
Yoon Jung, what am I going to do?

26
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,870
My poor Yoon Jung.
What am I supposed to do?

27
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,710
I can't go on anymore.

28
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>Thousands of photos were passed out</i>

29
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,680
<i>and hundreds of police
worked on her case.</i>

30
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,670
<i>Tens of thousands of people
joined in to help find Yoon Jung.</i>

31
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,750
<i>But Kim Yoon Jung came back
to us as a cold body.</i>

32
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,610
<i>After the suspect Seo Hyung Joon
took the fifty million won he demanded</i>

33
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,260
<i>he evaded the police and disappeared.</i>

34
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,170
<i>There is a warrant out for his arrest,
but seeing as he has not been caught yet</i>

35
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,680
<i>there is a high chance that he has
escaped to a foreign country.</i>

36
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,780
<i>This is a report on a cold case.</i>

37
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,450
<i>The statute of limitations on
Kim Yoon Jung's case is approaching.</i>

38
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,330
<i>The culprit must be caught
by August 29, 2015</i>

39
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,310
<i>in order to make them
pay for their crimes.</i>

40
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,330
<i>[The end]</i>

41
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,630
<i>[July 27, 2015]</i>

42
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,010
<i>[3 days until the statute of limitation
of Kim Yoon Jung's abduction passes]</i>

43
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,570
The problem is the unconscious act.

44
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,360
The trophy in the living room.
The picture on the desk.

45
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,050
You can look into the unconscious mind
through a book left in a bathroom.

46
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,910
It's referred to as
snooping in psychology.

47
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,270
So you found out through snooping?
<i>[Kang So Ra & Im Shi Wan Dating]</i>

48
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,550
About what? Those two dating?

49
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,970
No, not that.

50
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,220
That they were meeting at the back gate
of Hyunjin Park at 10:30 p.m.

51
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,620
Unless you were a ghost,
how would you know?

52
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,770
It's well-known that these three
were in a love triangle last year.

53
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,900
I know this drama. The manager was cool.

54
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,740
This is their recent
airport fashion picture.

55
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,890
One of the three in
the love triangle left the country

56
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,640
for three nights, four days.

57
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,750
So two of them had time to meet up
and reaffirm their stance.

58
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,400
This is Im Shi Wan's new place,
which he recently publicized.

59
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,190
The poster in the living area
is very big, isn't it?

60
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,140
Statistically, this means that he is very
prideful and likely self-disciplined.

61
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,150
Kang So Ra might stay in touch with him,
but wouldn't meet him so easily.

62
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,350
However, the day before Byun Yo Han's
return, it's likely he broke down first.

63
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,480
So, the date had to be yesterday.
July 26.

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
What about the time?
Why is it 10:30 p.m.?

65
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,370
Psychology comes into play
even with choosing a time.

66
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,960
Im Shi Wan had rehearsal
for a concert the next morning.

67
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,190
If you consider that into account,
and suppose he has to be up by 8:00 a.m.

68
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,720
it was a time that suited him
and gave him time to talk to Kang So Ra.

69
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,650
Considering they had to avoid people,
10:30 p.m. is the obvious time.

70
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,600
What about the location?
Why is it Hyunjin Park?

71
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,900
In 1989, during the Cold War

72
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,650
President Bush and Gorbachev didn't
meet in the US or the Soviet Union.

73
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,390
They had a summit in Malta.

74
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,070
Why? If there is a misunderstanding,
it's right to meet on neutral ground.

75
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,530
It's the same with love.

76
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,390
They feel like it's a confrontation too.

77
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,990
Would they want to meet at their homes?

78
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,830
It's in a neutral spot, not many lights,
and not many people.

79
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,490
It wouldn't be unnatural to
wear caps and jogging outfits.

80
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,250
Hyunjin Park back gate, okay?

81
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,410
All right, should we move
onto our next matter of business?

82
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,620
These two... where do you
think they will meet up?

83
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,770
They're dating? Wow, amazing!

84
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,760
How did you find out?

85
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,820
He dug through the garbage.

86
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,950
<i>[Cha Soo Hyun]</i>

87
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,210
I thought it was a homeless cat that
was digging through the garbage.

88
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,640
I was going to use rat poison.

89
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,650
Man, it was a cop. A cop.

90
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,060
Does a cat die if it eats rat poison?

91
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,560
Lieutenant Park Hae Young.

92
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,980
Lee Bo Young reported you
for stalking her.

93
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,060
Stalking?

94
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,190
Digging through
people's trash is stalking?

95
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,330
Then what is a bum that
eats out of the garbage?

96
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,920
An intruder?

97
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,940
You don't seem to understand
the situation here.

98
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,850
You're a cop and you just dug through
the trash of woman who lives alone.

99
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,890
Are you a pervert?

100
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,110
As if that weren't enough,
you sold tips to a reporter for money?

101
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,410
Money? Me?

102
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,290
Go through my bank account.
I haven't received any money.

103
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,500
This is just my hobby.

104
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,640
Others fish and knit.

105
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,540
I used my skill to share information.
Is that a crime?

106
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,800
What? You're not going
to listen, are you?

107
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,410
The higher-up's are cracking down to make
sure government employees work hard.

108
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,300
This just won't do.
Come on, Detective Cha.

109
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,140
You should report him as damaging
a cop's dignity and fire him.

110
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,420
Damage to dignity?

111
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,340
Should I tell you how a cop
damages their dignity?

112
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,490
This is your desk, isn't it?

113
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,080
Wonmi Parking Lot arson
and Jinya burglary case.

114
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,410
Oasis Room Salon case.

115
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,410
Are you screwing around with me because
you want your case load lessened?

116
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,260
You have it just piled it up here.

117
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,500
You're piling up this case and that case.

118
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,410
And yet you drag in wrong people like me.
That's damage to your dignity.

119
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,640
It's always people like that who hide it
from people front, beside, or behind.

120
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,120
They keep it for their own eyes
and keep it under their chair.

121
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,570
"Each pair of handcuffs comes with
2.5 liters of tears."

122
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,450
They keep something like this
and say to themselves.

123
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,970
"I'm still a good cop."
Something like that.

124
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,140
Isn't Batman too much?

125
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,920
I guess this is like a detective, but...

126
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,970
That is the desk of
a marketing business man.

127
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,960
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't do it.

128
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,820
The investigations guide is used
to put under hot ramen pots.

129
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,880
All his recent reading materials
are golf books.

130
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,950
You punk.

131
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,860
More important than that are
these colorful business cards.

132
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,340
I bet my life that Lee Bo Young's
manager's card is in here.

133
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,940
You guys are investigating because
you received the manager's request.

134
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,720
Otherwise, why would Violent Crimes
be looking into trash digging?

135
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Is this the dignity
you were referring to?

136
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,360
What a joke.

137
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,770
Is there anymore damage that can
be done to this country's police?

138
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,700
They say you should say right things
even if you're mouth is crooked.

139
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,960
But, you speak crookedly
even with a proper mouth.

140
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,410
Well, what kind of cop
has dignity anyway?

141
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,530
They don't teach that at
the Police University, right?

142
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,480
That's why you go around
digging garbage.

143
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,220
I wasn't digging. I was investigating.

144
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,050
By the way, why are you
dropping honorifics?

145
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,100
Why are you being like that?
We're all undignified here.

146
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,920
I dropping honorifics because I can.

147
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,880
Detective Cha, Violent Crimes Team 1.

148
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,290
Yes, I understand.

149
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,300
It was about to get fun.

150
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,790
I had fun.

151
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,740
She wants to forget about it.

152
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,580

I'll start the briefing on
Kim Yoon Jung's abduction.

185
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,970
The kidnapping occurred on July 29

186
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,650
after she was let out by
the school around 1 p.m.

187
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,670
It was reported
that same day at 6:44 p.m.

188
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,140
A letter asking for 50 million won
was sent 53 minutes after.

189
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,650
Everyone, please cooperate.
We are the Jinyang Police.

190

<i>We arrived at the cafe Firenze,
which was named in the letter.</i>

191
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,780
<i>The suspect was not on scene.</i>

192
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,190
<i>But his fingerprints were on the table.</i>

193
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,200
<i>We were able to determine
the suspect's identity.</i>

194
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,650
Suspect's name is Seo Hyung Joon.
He is 21 years old.

195
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,170
He is a medical student
enrolled in Sangjin University.

196
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,640
We deployed police to his apartment,
hometown, and school immediately.

197
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,530
But he had already run
and we have yet to capture him.

198
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,120
What about tracking his cell phone?

199
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,860
He has not paid his bill for two months,
so it is not activated.

200
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,510
Have you checked his credit card usage?

201
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,750
He had credit issues
and had a debt of 50 million won.

202
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
His credit cards are closed,
so we can't track him that way.

203
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,790
This world is full of bad people.

204
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,650
That man who kidnaps a child
for 50 million won is bad.

205
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,510
All of you, who can't catch him
in this tiny country, are even worse.

206
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,840
Hey, bird brains.
Don't you know what this case means?

207
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,020
The entire country is watching.

208
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,900
You found the suspect
and you can't even catch him?

209
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,650
We do have a lead.

210
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,020
I looked through his card usage.

211
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,420
I noticed a lot of items and brands
that a woman would use.

212
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,750
Seo Hyung Joon had a girlfriend.

213
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,460
He spoke to his closest friend recently
about difficulties with a woman he loved.

214
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,890
But he didn't reveal a name.

215
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,920
We're still digging around.

216
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,880
But, we haven't figured out who it is.

217
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,740
Chief! Yoon Jung's family have
received another blackmail letter.

218
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,640
They want 50 million won
by 10:00 at Seoyoung Park.

219
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,090
What are you all doing?
Why aren't you going?

220
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,090
About that blackmail letter
and the cafe the suspect was in...

221
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,090
Seo Hyung Joon's prints were there,
but they were only of his right thumb.

222
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,720
If he touched the table
and wrote a letter

223
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,910
his other fingerprints should be there.

224
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,270
It's strange that it's only the thumb.

225
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,900
It's as if someone left
the prints there on purpose.

226
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,040
So what?

227
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,260
We should look into Seo Hyung Joon's
hidden girlfriend some more.

228
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,730
So, look into her... by yourself.

229
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,380
You like doing things by yourself.

230

There are no batteries?

311
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, it's totally fried.

312
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,030
You came here because of that?
You're not even on duty.

313
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,500
Goodness sake.

314
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,120
Yes, I've been overworking lately.

315
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,990
This is just an obsession.

316
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,890
<i>This is the Sunil Psychiatric Hospital
in Hanjung-dong.</i>

317
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,100
<i>Someone has killed Seo Hyung Joon
and made it look like a suicide.</i>

318
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,450
I'm just here to find evidence
that I'm not crazy.

319
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:48,570
I'm looking for evidence
that I'm totally normal.

320
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,010
Am I stuck?

321
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,400
I am totally crazy.

322
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,010
Gosh!

323
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,640
That scared me.

324
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,250
<i>There is corpse with a noose around his
neck in the manhole behind the building.</i>

325
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,740
<i>It's Seo Hyung Joon, the suspect
of the Kim Yoon Jung case.</i>

326
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,110
Oh my gosh!
What am I doing right now?

327
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,460
That radio had no batteries.
It makes no sense.

328
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,510
Seriously now.

329
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,250
I'm wasting my time.

330
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,580
I'm leaving.

331
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,500
<i>[2 days until the statute of limitation
of Kim Yoon Jung's abduction passes]</i>

332
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,150
Over here.

333
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,490
How are the state of the bones?
Is anything strange about it?

334
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,860
Anything strange?

335
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,460
You're the strangest thing of all.

336
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,820
What's a dignified person
like you doing here?

337
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,780
How did you find that?

338
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, that...

339
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,090
And why did you call me?

340
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,880
Did you want to play detective
with me again?

341
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,750
I thought it would be better
to call someone I know.

342
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,170
Okay, so I know this will sound crazy.

343
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,110
Can you not ask me why?

344
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,930
You know the DNA of those skeletons?

345
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,550
Can you compare them
to the DNA of Seo Hyung Joon

346
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,620
the suspect of the Kim Yoon Jung
abduction case from fifteen years ago?

347
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,000
Kim Yoon Jung?

348
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,040
Kim Yoon Jung's abduction?

349
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,500
Gender is male.

350
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,450
Looking at the length of the spine,
I'd say his height was about 170 cm.

351
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,690
What about age?

352
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,400
It's not the person you've been
looking for, Detective Cha.

353
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,980
The age is wrong too.

354
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,830
Looking at the condition of the bones,
he was in his early 20's when he died.

355
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,800
What about the thumb bone?

356
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,400
I'll need to look at it more carefully.

357
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,040
But, there's a high probability that
it was cut off forcefully

358
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,470
with a scalpel or something
other sharp tool.

359
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,590
- Do you have the results?
- Yes.

360
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,850
So did you look for it?

361
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,360
There are three current police
named Lee Jae Han.

362
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,800
I spoke to them all.

363
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,780
None of them knew anything about
the Kim Yoon Jung abduction case.

364
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,920
Then was that man a ghost?

365
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,720
Who was this person anyway?

366
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,360
Okay, all right. Just hang up.

367
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,100
What's going on?

368
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,800
Am I losing my mind?

369
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,760
What is it?

370
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,360
What's with you?

371
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,360
How did you know that was
Seo Hyung Joon's corpse?

372
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,540
It was really him?

373
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,890
- That was really Seo Hyung Joon?
- Answer me!

374
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,730
How did you know
Seo Hyung Joon would be there?

375
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,530
Oh, I'm going to go crazy.

376
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,240
Let go of me, would you?

377
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,580
The only prints of Seo Hyung Joon's found
during investigation were of his thumb.

378
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,940
But, the body we found
was missing his thumb.

379
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,380
Who cut it off?

380
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,220
Kim Yoon Jung's kidnapper must have
killed Seo Hyun Joon and cut it off.

381
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,060
So the only person who knew
the body was there is the culprit.

382
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,810
How did you know?

383
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,650
What, exactly, is your relationship
to Seo Hyung Joon?

384
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,440
Stop it!

385
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,330
Is it true that Seo Hyung Joon's
body has been found?

386
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,280
Answer me!

387
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,880
Yes.

388
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,660
Okay, hand me all the files
on the remains.

389
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,090
Who are you to...

390
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,780
I have to find out who and why
Seo Hyung Joon was killed.

391
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,410
The National Forensics Service
is looking over the evidence now.

392
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,300
<i>If we can find evidence...</i>

393
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,900
<i>The case is 15 years old.</i>

394
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,090
It's hard enough to find evidence
and it's probably contaminated by now.

395
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,030
The evidence is gone now
and witnesses memory isn't reliable.

396
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,760
That's why cold cases are difficult.

397
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,430
But, Seo Hyung Joon's corpse is--

398
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,580
This isn't my call!

399
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,190
We have 29 hours left until statute
of limitations comes into effect.

400
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,310
We couldn't solve it for 15 years.

401
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,300
Do you think you can
solve it in that time?

402
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,520
Don't make this into a big deal
and follow procedure.

403
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,890
What are you doing right now?

404
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,250
Who is that person?

405
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,510
What are you going to do if you know?

406
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,400
This case is going to be closed
by the National Police Agency.

407
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,970
So stop it and just leave.

408
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,410
Has a suspect been revealed
for the Kim Yoon Jung case?

409
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,840
Where was the corpse discovered?

410
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,980
Chief, Chief!

411
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,950
<i>[Superintendent Kim Bum Joo]</i>
Yes.

412
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,890
I think that would be good promotional
opportunity for the police.

413
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,290
I understand.

414
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,570
Yes.

415
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,490
Come in.

416
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,090
Good work.

417
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,540
It turns out that
Detective Lee Jae Han was right.

418
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,540
What do you mean?

419
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,270
Seo Hyung Joon was missing a thumb.

420
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,850
They are 15 year old skeletal remains.

421
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,060
Of course, they are damaged.

422
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,400
They autopsy reports that
it was cut off by a scalpel.

423
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,420
You punk, how dare you
talk back to me like that.

424
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,140
Will you take responsibility if
Lee Jae Han's case gets exposed too?

425
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,900
I suppose....
suicide is the simplest way.

426
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,100
Yes, the fax is coming in. Yes.

427
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,720
You're sure?

428
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,050
Years 1995 to 2000.

429
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,630
Yes, thank you.

430
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,710
Let's talk.

431
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,210
Later.

432
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,190
Are you going to give up like this?

433
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,550
Detective Cha.

434
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,120
You asked me before
if I know the real culprit.

435
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,550
Yes, I do know. I saw that person.

436
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,400
I saw the person who took Yoon Jung.

437
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,250
I didn't get a clear look at her face.

438
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,380
But I saw the culprit.

439
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,020
Are you...

440
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,660
telling the truth?

441
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,910
It wasn't Seo Hyung Joon.

442
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:47,280
It was a woman who took Yoon Jung.

443
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,360
Why didn't you saying anything
until now if you saw?

444
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,230
Did you think I wouldn't have?

445
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,480
- It wasn't a man!
- <i>I told them.</i>

446
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,610
<i>But no one listened to me.</i>

447
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,010
<i>I still believed in the beginning.
They were cops, after all.</i>

448
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,610
<i>"If I wait a little bit,
they'll catch that woman."</i>

449
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,650
<i>"They will catch her someday."</i>

450
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,530
<i>But time passed and nothing changed.</i>

451
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,440
<i>So, I went back to the station.</i>

452
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,760
<i>I went back many times
and it had been years.</i>

453
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,640
It was the same every time.

454
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,490
"All right. Now go back home."

455
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,840
Just like before, no one listened.

456
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,300
You people were always like that.

457
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,710
I learned the reason why later.

458
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,220
<i>Re-opening the case of
Kim Yoon Jung's abduction</i>

459
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:53,090
<i>it meant that the police would
have to admit they were wrong.</i>

460
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,070
<i>The police would have
to wear shame on their faces!</i>

461
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,560
Have you found the body of the suspect?

462
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,160
Can you tell us the results
of the investigation?

463
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,070
Tell us what happened.

464
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,120
Talk to us.

465
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,070
What about the culprit?

466
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,110
Did you get him?

467
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,900
Are you going to pretend not to
hear me like the other detectives?

468
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,600
Detective Cha. Hey!

469
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,280
Detective Cha!

470
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,590
Do you not why cold cases are the worst?

471
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,640
When you know who the criminal is
and what their motive was

472
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,190
then you know why your family died
and how it happened.

473
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,970
So even though it's hard,
you can bury it in your heart.

474
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,330
With cold cases, you don't know
why or how your loved ones died.

475
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,170
You can't forget it.

476
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,080
Every day is like hell.

477
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,380
So are you going to forget
about it like this?

478
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:58,980
The criminal couldn't take the pressure
after committing the crime.

479
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,320
He took his own life.

480
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,290
I apologize for being so late.

481
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,850
No.

482
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,550
I'm saying I'll catch her.

483
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,650
So stop it and go back.

484
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,190
How, Detective Cha?

485
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,490
It won't be enough even with
all the cops helping you.

486
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,170
And you're going to do it alone?

487
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,990
Let's do it together. I'll help too.

488
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,800
I told you.

489
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,930
You're not suited to be a cop.

490
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,070
Don't waste the little time
I have, and go.

491
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,160
There she is. She's coming out.

492
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,350
Tell us about the investigation.

493
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,900
Do you have results?

494
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,080
You're in charge of
the investigation, right?

495
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,180
How did you find
Seo Hyung Joon's body?

496
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,270
How did the corpse look
when you found it?

497
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,170
Sorry, I have no comments right now.

498
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,760
Are you sure it's suicide?

499
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,120
No, it was not suicide.

500
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
Seo Hyung Joon was murdered.

501
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,320
He was murdered by Yoon Jung's abductor.

502
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,760
- Is that true?
- Stop.

503
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,530
- Stop. Just leave.
- What evidence do you have?

504
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,880
I am the first witness
who discovered the body.

505
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,000
He was discovered at Sunil Psychiatric
Hospital with a severed thumb.

506
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,580
- It was not suicide.
- That's enough.

507
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,680
Stop him.

508
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,670
Yoon Jung and Seo Hyung Joon's killer

509
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,140
is a nurse who worked
at Sunil fifteen years ago.

510
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,350
She is in her mid 30's and around
165 centimeters tall.

511
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,560
She is a nurse who has
experience with a scalpel.

512
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,260
Get him out of here now!

513
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,960
You lived without guilt for 15 years.

514
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,740
You're done now!

515
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,190
We have irrefutable evidence now.

516
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,570
Are you crazy?

517
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,770
You said you want to catch her.
This is the only way.

518
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,180
There's no time!

519
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,560
There are only 27 hours left.

520
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,460
This is our last chance.

521
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,910
Turn on the news.

522
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,070
<i>No, it was not suicide.</i>

523
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,640
<i>Seo Hyung Joon was murdered.</i>

524
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,600
<i>He was murdered by Yoon Jung's abductor.</i>

525
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,670
<i>I am the first witness
who discovered the body.</i>

526
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:24,310
<i>He was discovered at Sunil Psychiatric
Hospital with a severed thumb.</i>

527
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,650
- <i>It was not suicide.</i>
- Who the heck is that punk?

528
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,450
<i>He was discovered at Sunil Psychiatric
Hospital with a severed thumb.</i>

529
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,780
<i>Yoon Jung and Seo Hyung Joon's killer is
a nurse who worked at Sunil 15 years ago.</i>

530
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,300
<i>She is in her mid 30's and around
165 centimeters tall.</i>

531
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,240
<i>She is a nurse who has experience
with a scalpel.</i>

532
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,730
<i>You lived without guilt for 15 years.</i>

533
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:52,440
<i>You're done now!
We have irrefutable evidence now.</i>

534
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,380
Sunil Psychiatric Hospital?

535
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,220
Is there anyone we know from there?

536
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,800
I don't really know.

537
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,440
<i>[Kang Sae Young]</i>
Did you see the news?

538
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,280
They mentioned Sunil Hospital.

539
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,930
<i>Will they be able to make
an arrest within 26 hours?</i>

540
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,320
<i>That is the issue right now.</i>

541
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,210
I tried to stop it.

542
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,920
What were you doing?

543
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,950
I told him to do it.

544
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,740
What? It wasn't suicide, you say?

545
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,530
And you allowed him to say it?

546
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,810
Are you in your right mind?
What did I say to you?

547
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,090
Does what I say mean nothing?

548
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,540
I did what you told me to.
You said to follow procedure.

549
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,250
- What?
- Detective Cha...

550
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,550
A body was found and there
was evidence of murder.

551
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:01,410
Also, I even have a cop
who witnessed the event.

552
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,980
I thought that investigating this
was proper procedure.

553
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,720
- A witness?
- I saw it.

554
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,650
The kidnapper was a woman.

555
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,850
<i>The third level of the jungle gym
came to her shoulder.</i>

556
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,890
If you use that to measure,
she's about 165 centimeters.

557
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,770
<i>Necklace and bracelet were both garish
and she was wearing similar shoes.</i>

558
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,020
Seeing as how she kidnapped
a child for her purpose

559
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,860
I think there's a high possibility
that she has

560
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,260
narcissistic personality disorder.

561
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,860
With a personality like that,
she won't care or consider others.

562
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,670
<i>There's no way Seo Hyung Joon colluded.</i>

563
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,550
<i>She likely acted alone to begin with.</i>

564
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,930
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

565
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,340
<i>She probably got caught in the act
by Seo Hyung Joon.</i>

566
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,140
<i>She wouldn't have wanted to use him
as it would be too risky.</i>

567
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,230
Kid, kid!

568
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,730
<i>Seo Hyung Joon would tell her to turn
herself in or insist on doing it himself.</i>

569
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,200
- <i>Turn yourself in now.</i>
- That's why she killed him.

570
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,830
I'm going to call the cops.

571
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,820
<i>"I better kill that guy."</i>

572
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,420
<i>"And then use him as my scapegoat."</i>

573
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,410
How would she kill a man
that's stronger than her?

574
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,130
Take him to a place she knows best.
A place she's comfortable in.

575
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,600
Also a place that has drugs
that she can use to kill him.

576
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,000
- What else should I move?
- <i>She took him to Sunil.</i>

577
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,170
You have to turn yourself in after this.

578
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,500
You're crazy! Hey!

579
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,950
<i>She cut Seo Hyung Joon's thumb off
there and killed Yoon Jung.</i>

580
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:36,280
That area was inaccessible
and unknown to the public.

581
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,610
Unlike her red lips and high heels,
her nails were clean cut.

582
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,410
That's because she couldn't
get manicures for her job.

583
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:45,320
She would have been an OR nurse
who knew how to use a scalpel.

584
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,200
You have no evidence at all.

585
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,280
Are you taking the word
of that young kid?

586
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,170
- It's worth following up on.
- What?

587
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,370
The body was found where
outsiders can't even enter.

588
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,260
It was a place only employees know about.

589
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,860
The evidence of the thumb
being severed and the injection shot

590
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,820
shows that it was someone in
the medical field used to giving shots.

591
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,470
But it wasn't a doctor.

592
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,600
It's a log of Sunil Hospital's employees
five years before they shut down.

593
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,880
They only had two female doctors.
One was in her 40's.

594
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,480
The other was pregnant and on leave.

595
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,770
And if you look through
Seo Hyung Joon's credit card details

596
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,420
they were all brands favored
by women in their early 20's.

597
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,800
It's been 15 years now,
so she'd be in her mid-30's.

598
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,780
So, 15 years ago

599
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,300
<i>the culprit worked
at Sunil Hospital as a nurse.</i>

600
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,310
<i>And she is currently
a female in her mid 30's.</i>

601
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,020
Have you seen Nurse Kang?
I haven't seen her for a while.

602
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,190
I've been looking for her too,
but I haven't seen her.

603
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:16,150
By the way, didn't Nurse Kang
work at Sunil Hospital?

604
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,680
That thing on the news bothered me.

605
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,930
Did you check the vitals
for the patient in Room 1131?

606
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:33,490
<i>Do you think you'll be able
to catch her with just that?</i>

607
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,060
There are over a hundred nurses in here.

608
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,950
Are you going to meet all of them
in the time we have left?

609
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,040
We don't have to meet them all.

610
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,360
Gosh, can't you just be quiet?

611
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,460
We made some noise about this.

612
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,120
We'll be able to reduce
the hundred nurses from Sunil.

613
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,320
Someone will know the culprit.

614
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,970
You did that to get tips?

615
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,460
Did you even get a single call?

616
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,170
Not yet.

617
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,040
You punk. Are you playing?

618
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,050
We have to wait one hour.

619
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,020
Suspecting someone you work with...

620
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,930
First, they will try to tell
themselves that it's not true.

621
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,320
Once that person behaves suspiciously,
they will call the police.

622
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,830
Suspicious behavior?

623
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,930
I lied on TV that I had
irrefutable evidence.

624
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,320
She thought it was hidden for 15 years.

625
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,830
What will she do if she thinks
she will get caught?

626
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,220
She will behave out of character.

627
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,950
She will either disappear suddenly
or organize things.

628
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,730
What are you doing? Pick up.

629
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,910
Okay.

630
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,470
This is Jinyang Violent Crimes, Team 1.

631
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,640
What?

632
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,300
The Kim Yoon Jung abduction case?

633
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,230
Yes, yes. Go on.

634
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,290
- Yes, this Jinyang Violent Crimes.
- Yes.

635
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,920
Yes, yes.

636
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,570
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

637
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:25,580
There's a nurse at Kyunghwan Hospital
and her description is match.

638
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,540
Name is Son Da Yeon and age 36.

639
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:31,860
She told the tipster not to mention
that she worked at Sunil Hospital.

640
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,500
She said she'd meet her mom and left.

641
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,060
It's the same with this call too.

642
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,400
Please allow us
to officially investigate.

643
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:48,550
We are going over everything we found
at Seo Hyung Joon's crime scene.

644
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,970
If we could find something small

645
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,100
we could do a DNA test with
our suspect and get our kidnapper.

646
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,210
If something goes wrong,
I'll take full responsibility.

647
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,280
You'll take responsibility?

648
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,130
Who are you to take responsibility?

649
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,700
Get the culprit and get a confession.

650
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,740
Or get evidence that
you have the culprit.

651
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,330
You need it within 24 hours
in order to prosecute.

652
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,130
Do you have confidence?

653
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,490
Yes.

654
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,210
If you can't get the kidnapper

655
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,260
you'll get it twice as bad for
the incident that happened today.

<i>[20 hours before statue

659
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,530
She was the one using
Seo Hyung Joon's card.

660
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:58,400
She scams people
and has a shopping addiction.

661
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:02,310
She used it on mostly luxury brands.

Lawyer Lee?

663
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,840
<i>She likes bright colored
and unique designs.</i>

664
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,360
<i>She's very aware of trends.</i>

665
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:13,200
<i>It's very likely that she would carry
around a mirror as a necessity.</i>

What was she usually like?

667
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,450
Did she spend?

668
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,970
No, she is paying her mom's hospital fees
so she doesn't even use her card.

669
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,400
It's not her.

670
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,840
The culprit finds personal
relationships bothersome.

671
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,830
People like that don't even
take care of animals.

672
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,700
This is Choong Joo Hospital.

673
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,640
She didn't work at Sunil Psychiatric.
It was Sunil Neurology.

674
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,880
The person who called in the tip
didn't like the nurse.

675

<i>If you look at the crime process,

She worked in surgery before working
in Sunil Psychiatric Hospital?

683

Yes, that's right.

684

Where is she now?

685
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,610
She suddenly disappeared
after the news yesterday.

686
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,930
Her phone is off too.

687
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:12,290

689

<i>I sent you a picture.

693
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,820
What did he say?

694
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,400
What happened? Did you arrest her?

695
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,700
She's not home.

696
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,420
I checked every place she'd be,
but I don't see her.

697
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:05,800
- Cellphone?
- That cellphone is still turned off.

698
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,670
This is Kang Sae Young's
credit card activity.

699
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,260
She recently reserved a hotel room.

700
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,470
Where is this Shilo Hotel? You punk!

701
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,150
It's in Busan. I wrote it there.

In Busan, Busan.

703

Gosh. We don't have time.
It's already past 9:30.

What is going on?

709
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:59,560
I heard that someone else is the killer.

710
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,330
Then do you have the killer
who killed my Yoon Jung?

711
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,890
Didn't you say you caught the killer?

Please just tell me something.
Why is nobody talking?

713

We're not done with going
through the evidence yet.

We only have one and a half hour.

I'm going to the court house
to wait with the prosecutor.

718

July 29, 2000

01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,220
you kidnapped Kim Yoon Jung
from Ginyang Elementary School.

723
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,710
You got 50 million won
from the family as a ransom.

724
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,990
And then brutally murdered Kim Yoon Jung.

725
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,320
Is that accurate?

726
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,130
I did no such thing.

727
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,290
Why are you doing this to me?

728
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,250
You worked at Sunil Hospital
in year 2000, correct?

Yes.

You don't know who Kim Yoon Jung
or Seo Hyung Joon is, huh?

733
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:27,620
Then why did you go into hiding
after yesterday's news aired?

734
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:30,350
What hiding? I didn't.

735
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,630
You should just go back now.
You did all you can.

736
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,310
What kind of shoes were they?

737
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,130
I couldn't figure that part out.

738
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:49,640
Why would she not pack
her new high end shoes?

739
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:53,200
Did you see what kind of shoes
she was wearing?

740
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,430
I'm not sure.

741
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,780
I think they were brown.

- Were they brown? Is that correct?
- Yes.

743

Yes, they were brown.

744
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,070
Why was your phone turned off?

745
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,650
I lost it.

746
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:18,510
I just took a day off from work.
You can ask Nurse Yoon about it.

01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,680
Nurse Yoon?

748
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,700
She said she'll let
the hospital know for me.

749
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,010
Gosh, this person won't listen!

750
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,330
What the heck are you doing?

751
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,560
This woman isn't her.

752
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,850
The mug handle was placed
by a left-handed person.

753
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,820
The scissors were also
for left-handed person.

754
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,270
The owner of the cabinet...
The culprit is left-handed.

01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,990
The kidnapping case
15 years ago, and now!

778
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,610
She's showing off her criminal tactics.

779
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,310
She thinks that she's better than others.

780
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:30,620
That she can manipulate
and control the police.

781
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,380
<i>I'm sure she's close by.</i>

782
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,600
She's probably watching see
how we're being manipulated.

783
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,010
Send Yoon Soo Ah's
information to my phone.

784
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:45,070
- Okay.
- Let's go. Hurry.

785
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,640
When did you meet that woman
at the hospital again?

786
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,690
Around 7:30.

787
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:09,300
Yes, check the CCTV from
Youngin Hospital to Jinyang for me.

788
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,840
The plate number is 20, Ma, 8178.

789
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,050
Detective Cha.

790
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,170
<i>[40 minutes before statute
of limitations comes into effect.]</i>

791
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,750
I found her!

792
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,880
<i>I'm sure she's close by.</i>

793
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,270
<i>She's probably watching to see</i>

794
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,330
<i>how we're being manipulated.</i>

795
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,600
Yoon Soo Ah.

796
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,500
<i>[20 minutes before statute
of limitations comes into effect.]</i>

<i>If you can't catch the perpetrator again,
how unfortunate for the one who died.</i>

799
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,660
<i>Why?</i>

800
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:35,390
<i>Okay, it's getting big.</i>

801
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,780
<i>You're finished now.</i>

802
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,660
<i>I think this will be my last message.</i>

803
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,280
<i>What the heck did you do to me?</i>

804
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,420
<i>You should take the responsibility.
That's the least you can do.</i>

805
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,690
<i>- What is this?
- The most famous cold case in Korea.</i>

806
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:49,810
<i>I think it'll be worthwhile.</i>

807
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:52,060
<i>Not all cops are the same.</i>

808
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,670
<i>Why don't you just tell us
to rest and not work?</i>

809
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,470
<i>Let me just sleep for two months.</i>

810
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
<i>Detective, it's me Park Hae Young.</i>

811
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:02,450
<i>I'm Policeman 22. I'm in Youngsan forest.
Where are you?</i>

812
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,670
That transmission was real?<i></i>

813
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:07,640
<i>Hey! Is anyone here?</i>

814
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,160
<i>With this radio, we can save.</i>

815
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,210
<i>Detective, Detective?</i>
