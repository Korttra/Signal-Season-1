00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,650

Thanks to you, we solved the case.</i>

<i>You saw the news, right?
Which precinct are you at?</i>

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,400

cold case squad in Seoul.</i>

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,790
<i>So he did move away.</i>

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,030
<i>I think it's worth a try.</i>

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,320

Do you have a Lieutenant
Park Hae Young on your team?

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,310
<i>Well, I heard something weird
on the radio.</i>

25

Hey, hey.
Did you do this?

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,700
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,690
The victim Lee Mi Sun
is listed as as alive.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,960
That is correct. She is alive.

36

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,650
That was only an attempt.

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,730
What do you mean by that?
What attempt?

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,650
Lee Mi Sun definitely died.

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,250
Profiler Park Hae Young.
Can't you read?

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,540
Lee Mi Sun most definitely
survived that attack.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,210
I... I will untie you.

46
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,790
Okay, I'm going to help you out.
Just hold on.

47
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,970
It's all right. I'm a policeman.

48
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,720
Hold on.

49
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,360
- What are you doing...
- You little punk.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,850
Wait!

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,690
Why are doing this?

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,890
You punk.

53
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,150
What can I do for you?

54
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,510
I'm Lieutenant Park Hae Young
with the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

55
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you Detective Kim Tae Young

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,860
the one who was in charge
of the Gyeonggi Nambu case?

57
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,930
Wait, I just need to ask you one thing.

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,240
Leave. I have nothing to say.

59
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,660
About Hyunpoong Station...

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,070
Did Lee Mi Sun really survive and live?

61
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,330
What happened back then?

62
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,340
Everything happened
because of that darn officer.

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,340
Officer Lee Jae Han from
the Youngsan precinct.

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,120
Lee Jae Han?

65
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,680
He was saying some nonsense about
a radio transmission he had received.

66
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,920
Radio transmission?

67
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,170
That guy ruined everything.

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,490
That guy did!

69
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,020
Hello.

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,830
Get out. Hurry up!

71
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,130
Gosh, I can't believe this.

72
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,680
Seriously...

73
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,560
- Is this him?
- Yes, I caught him on the scene.

74
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,530
There is also a witness
who was nearly attacked.

75
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,640
Detective, it really isn't me.

76
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,640
Be quiet. Take this guy inside.

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,870
Why are you doing this to someone
who's done nothing wrong?

78
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,240
This is so unfair to me!

79
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,570
- I'm going insane here.
- Just get in.

80
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,420
I'm telling you that it's not me!

81
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,210
- Good work.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,580
Good job.

83
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,720
<i>It's Detective Lee Jae Han.
Are you there, Lieutenant Park Hae Young?</i>

84
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,470
<i>It's the corpse of Seo Hyung Joon,
the suspect of the Kim Yoon Jung case.</i>

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,430
<i>Seo Hyung Joon died in the year 2000,
but he said it was a body.</i>

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,870
<i>He didn't say it was skeletal remains.</i>

87
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,470
I think this might be
my last transmission.

88
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,910
Year 2000... last transmission.

89
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,440
<i>But, this is not the end.</i>

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,720
<i>They will happen again.</i>

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,450
At that time...
You must convince me.

92
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,520
The year will be 1989.
The Lee Jae Han of that time.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,440
Officer Lee Jae Han of the year 1989.

94
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,620
Officer 22, Gyeonggi Youngsan precinct.
Officer Lee Jae Han, who is this?

95
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,810
Is there a cop in this country
who doesn't know that?

96
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,070
<i>The seventh was in
a field of reeds by Highway 3.</i>

97
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,490
<i>The eighth was on the train tracks
by Hyunpoong Station.</i>

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,320
<i>Everything happened
because of that darn officer.</i>

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,030
Officer Lee Jae Han from
the Youngsan precinct.

100
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,600
About the eighth murder occurring on
the Hyunpoong Station train tracks...

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,870
Get out of here!

102
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,650
<i>He was saying some nonsense about
a radio transmission he had received.</i>

103
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,420
There's no way.
This makes no sense at all.

104
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,360
<i>Officer 22, this is Officer Lee Jae Han
from the Youngsan precinct.</i>

105
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,710
Officer 22.

106
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,300
Officer Lee Jae Han, Youngsan precinct.
Who and where are you?

107
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,810
Who are you?

108
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,830
Lieutenant Park Hae Young?
Yes, it's Lee Jae Han.

109
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,160
Who are you, seriously?
What have you done to me?

110
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

111
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,120
But I did catch the killer on
the Hyunpoong train tracks.

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,830
Everything is thanks to you,
Lieutenant Park.

113
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,120
But I'm just asking
because I'm so curious.

114
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,810
How did you know about
the Hyunpoong train tracks?

115
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,900
Are trying to joke around
with me right now?

116
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,550
Where are you right now?
I'll be there immediately, so tell me.

117
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,940
<i>Where are you?</i>

118
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,790
Where else would I be?
I'm in front of Ohsung precinct.

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,770
I just handed over Choi Young Shin.

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
<i>[Suspected arrested - Choi Young Shin]</i>

121
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,670
You really...

122
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,720
arrested Choi Young Shin?

123
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>Yes, I caught Choi Young Shin.</i>

124
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,390
<i>[Suspected arrested - Choi Young Shin]</i>
He was a young unemployed kid.

125
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,370
Are you really telling me
that you're in the year 1989?

126
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,390
Why do you keep acting this way?
Are you sick or something?

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I'm not sure what you're up to here.

128
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,710
But, if you're really in the year 1989

129
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,710
<i>Choi Young Shin will die!</i>

130
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,740
You people are driving me crazy!

131
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,240
Are detectives allowed
to treat a person like this?

132
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,690
Get up!

133
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,880
- Get up!
- Hey, punk!

134
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,770
Get walking now.
What are you doing?

135
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,660
Detective, hold on a bit.

136
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,490
Wait up.

137
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,830
What are you talking about?
Why would Choi Young Shin die?

138
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,070
<i>[Dies during investigation of seizure]</i>
Choi Young Shin is not the killer!

139
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,840
While Choi Young Shin is dying

140
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,600
the eighth victim dies in front
of the Ohsung-dong Supermarket.

141
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,460
<i>If you really are a cop in 1989,
you should be able to stop this.</i>

142
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,780
What in the world are you talking about?

143
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,760
Hello... Lieutenant?

144
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,900
Lieutenant?

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Hurry up! Walk properly!

146
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,270
What kind of games
do you think you're playing?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,380
What's wrong with him?

148
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,380
No, you can't.

149
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,410
What's going on?

150
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,430
What is it? What, what!

151
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,310
Hey, hey!

152
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,740
You can't die.

153
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,050
Min Joo...

154
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,120
Another victim has been found!

155
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,690
By the Ohsung-dong Supermarket.
She's the eighth victim.

156
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,310
<i>Choi Young Shin is not the killer.</i>

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,160
<i>While Choi Young Shin is dying</i>

158
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,850
<i>the eighth victim dies in front
of the Ohsung-dong Supermarket.</i>

159
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,910
<i>[Unfortunate Death of Young Man
Who Died as a Suspect]</i>

160
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,090
<i>Even the articles have changed.</i>

161
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,290
<i>[Youngsan Precinct, Officer Lee Jae Han]</i>

162
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,480
<i>How could this be?</i>

163
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,820
<i>Those transmissions were real.</i>

164
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,260
Just a moment is all I need.

165
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,970
Didn't you hear me
telling you to get out?

166
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,560
We are re-investigating
the Gyeonggi Nambu case.

167
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,290
Your wife was the only one to survive--

168
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,480
I've already spoken to the detectives.

169
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,410
It was dark and she couldn't
even see his face.

170
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,970
I know it's forward of me to ask, but
could I look at your wife's belongings?

171
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,290
Like you said, my wife lived
through that terrible attack.

172
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,190
But, do you know what really
killed her in the end?

173
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,900
It's people like you.

174
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,370
"What happened? How did it happen?"

175
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,690
She doesn't want to remember,
so why do you ask again and again?

176
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,990
You were the ones
who drove her to her death.

177
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,980
I am sorry.

178
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,990
I'll come back another time.
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,770
What brings you here?

180
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,380
Are you always this way?

181
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,430
Does it scare you that
I'm always this way?

182
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,670
We don't only get scorned
and insulted by other detectives.

183
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,190
The families of victims are worse.

184
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,890
If you can't catch the criminal,
it's pretty bad.

185
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,970
Excuse me.

186
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm sorry about my dad.

187
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,650
Reporters and other people
keep coming by.

188
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,360
He's had a very hard time.

189
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm sorry to ask you this.

190
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:30,300
But has your mother spoken
to you about the incident?

191
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,690
We haven't heard about the incident.

192
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,690
Back at the store, you asked
to see my mom's belongings.

193
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,930
She rarely went out
and mostly stayed home.

194
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,370
There really isn't much.

195
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,250
What about a diary or journal,
something like that?

196
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,190
No, this is it.

197
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,200
Even if she were alive now...

198
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,350
I'm sure she told the detectives
everything back then.

199
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,490
She told me that she tried her
very best in that investigation.

200
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,270
She said that it was because of him
that we could even had that photo.

201
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,450
The officer who rescued her on
the Hyunpoong train tracks.

202
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,100
She was pregnant with me at the time.

203
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,980
If he had come even a little later...

204
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,180
If he hadn't been there at
that place at that exact time

205
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,960
neither my mother nor I
would be in this world.

206
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,740
She went looking for him a few times,
but he wouldn't meet with her.

207
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,170
She couldn't thank him in person.

208
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,830
So she said she had to be good
to other detectives at least.

209
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,340
Thank you.

210
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,310
- Thank you.
- Bye.

211
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,660
Why aren't you doing the analysis
I assigned you?

212
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,460
What's your real reason for being here?

213
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,100
Well...

214
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,470
Answer me.
Why have you come see the families?

215
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,350
What if...

216
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,910
What do you think it would be like if you
could get communicate with the past?

217
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,460
This might sound like
complete and utter nonsense--

218
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,930
So you got some sort of message from
the past and came to see the family?

219
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,900
You call that an excuse?

220
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,830
I just can't communicate with you.

221
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,850
All right then.

222
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,830
I will just go back to doing
my duties.

223
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,690
I would ask someone to protect
a person important to me.

224
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
What?

225
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,670
If I could communicate
with the past, that is...

226
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,520
What if that makes
everything into a big mess?

227
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,350
If I do nothing, I'd regret that too.

228
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,370
Isn't it better to try something
even if it becomes a mess?

229
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,060
<i>If he had come even a little later...</i>

230
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,810
<i>If he hadn't been there at that place
at that exact time...</i>

231
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,350
<i>neither my mother nor I
would be in this world.</i>

232
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,650
<i>What do you think it would be like if
you could get communicate with the past?</i>

233
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Let me finish it.

234
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,160
<i>And let's talk then.</i>

235
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,600
<i>I would ask someone to protect
a person important to me.</i>

236
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,290
<i>They will start again.</i>

237
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,690
<i>At that time...
You must convince me.</i>

238
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,960
<i>The year will be 1989.
The Lee Jae Han of that time.</i>

239
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,480
<i>The past can be changed.</i>

240
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,790
<i>Don't ever give up.</i>

241
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,080
<i>I don't know why
this is happening right now.</i>

242
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,810
<i>I can save them with the help
of these radio transmissions.</i>

243
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,800
<i>I'll save the people that die.</i>

244
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
<i>And I can catch the killer.</i>

245
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,380
<i>Eighth victim, Lee Mi Sun. Age 25.</i>

246
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,980
<i>Ninth, Hwang Min Joo. Bus employee.</i>

247
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,650
<i>Tenth, Kim Won Kyung. Age 22.</i>

248
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,480
<i>After Detective Lee Jae Han's
transmissions and Lee Mi Sun lived</i>

249
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,890
<i>one less person has died,
but the number of victims is the same.</i>

250
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,740
<i>Hwang Min Joo, Kim Won Kyung.
The victims are the same.</i>

251
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,680
<i>But the dates of the deaths are earlier
and the locations have changed.</i>

252
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,180
<i>Are you talking about
the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders?</i>

253
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,180
<i>Is there a cop in this country
who doesn't know that?</i>

254
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,920
<i>The seventh was in
a field of reeds by Highway 3.</i>

255
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,500
The eighth was on the train tracks
by Hyunpoong Station.

256
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Hyunpoong Station changed into attempted
murder because of the transmissions.

257
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,170
Something happened to
the killer at that time.

258
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,850
Something that forced him
to kill his victims earlier.

259
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>His locations were mainly mountains,
reeds, narrow field paths.</i>

260
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,360
<i>Places without many people
where no one would be watching.</i>

261
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,290
<i>The eighth and ninth were originally
on a field path and a mineral spring.</i>

262
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,100
<i>The new locations are an alley
and in front of a supermarket.</i>

263
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,670
<i>Comparatively, they are very open
and used more often.</i>

264
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,840
<i>His hunting grounds have changed.</i>

265
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,400
<i>But... why?</i>

266
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,220
These are personal information
of all the victims, one to nine.

267
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm telling you.
This case is impossible.

268
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,690
Give it a rest and look it over.

269
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,700
<i>I'm the only one who knows
about this change.</i>

270
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,200
<i>I will find out.</i>

271
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,140
<i>The reason for why
they were killed earlier.</i>

272
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,300
<i>I need to find the killer
before someone dies again.</i>

273
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,210
What about his face?

274
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,050
I couldn't see because of his hat.

275
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,080
Do you even know where you lost him?

276
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,960
I chased him to the the street.

277
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,690
- I thought it was him.
- Just answer the questions.

278
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,930
I'm not too sure.

279
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,080
So, you don't know his face.

280
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,790
You don't know anything.

281
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,580
You call yourself a cop, huh?

282
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,620
Saving that woman
only cost you your job.

283
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,740
But Chang Soo might have gone to jail!

284
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,930
Stop it, stop it.

285
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,410
Detective, can you please find
Lieutenant Park for me?

286
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,360
- If you could just find him...
- Stop that nonsense.

287
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,110
Just hand in your radio and badge.

288
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,460
- But...
- I said hand it in!

289
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,650
I know it all.

290
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,070
Hey, who is Park Hae Young?

291
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,540
Where is Park Hae Young?

292
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,720
- What is this...
- Is it you?

293
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,900
You jerk.

294
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,190
Someone died because of you.

295
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,630
What are you going to do?
How will you take responsibility?

296
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,540
What do you want?

297
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,920
It has nothing to do with you.

298
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,680
Aren't you looking for me?

299
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,460
I'm Park Hae Young.

300
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,240
- Do you know him, Lieutenant Park?
- No.

301
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,010
What are you doing in a police station?

302
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,310
Sorry.

303
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,510
Get over here. This won't do.

304
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm sorry.

305
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,990
Hey!

306
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,020
<i>Hey!</i>

307
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,280
<i>Are you okay?</i>

308
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,080
Maybe she didn't see me.

309
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,790
Oh, you startled me.

310
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,130
Officer.

311
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,110
Are you okay?

312
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,090
Yes, of course I am.

313
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,810
Would you like it if I weren't okay?

314
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,880
Well, then...

315
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,300
Officer Lee.

316
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,890
No, I wouldn't. Be strong.

317
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,880
Yes.

318
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,840
Wait a minute.

319
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Oh, sorry.

320
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,410
This is a taser.
You turn it on like this.

321
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,240
Since the world is such a scary place.

322
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,890
Thank you.

323
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,520
She's inside. She's inside now.

324
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,580
I will catch the culprit
with my own hands.

325
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,140
I'll be man and put him in jail
and get promoted too.

326
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,710
I'll be confident
and ask her out on a date.

327
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,160
Thank you... thanks.

328
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,950
<i>[Ohsung Police Department]</i>

329
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,440
I met the families of all nine victims.

330
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,300
The victims were all in different age
groups and had different jobs.

331
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,710
They all lived in different areas too.

332
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,530
They had only one thing in common.

333
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,880
The all died while taking the bus home.

334
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,600
Really?

335
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,320
Wow, that is an amazing
thing to have in common.

336
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,460
There was no subway back then.
Of course, they took the bus.

337
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,160
Are they supposed to walk?

338
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,830
I put the locations of their death
into the Geopros program.

339
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,910
I got the result of a bus
that is currently running.

340
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,130
Bus 1508.

341
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,740
I checked with the bus company.

342
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,640
That route was around 26 years ago too.

343
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,940
Back then, it was bus 95.

344
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,990
The eighth victim, Hwang Min Joo,
worked for that bus company too.

345
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,790
Isn't that too strange
to be just coincidence?

346
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,480
Bus...

347
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,500
Hey, look at this route.

348
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,830
It goes all over Youngsan.

349
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,690
I bet half the citizens of Youngsan
took this bus.

350
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,610
I wouldn't say this is something
the victims had in common.

351
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,290
This is something that
couldn't be avoided.

352
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,250
Senior Kim is right.

353
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,300
It's a little lacking
to be considered a lead.

354
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Right.

355
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,630
What about Hyunpoong Station?

356
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,830
Bus 95 goes by Hyunpoong Station too.

357
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,810
Yes, that's right.

358
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,090
About where is that?

359
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,350
Here.

360
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,630
Detective Cha is right.

361
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,400
Bus... it's the bus.

362
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,930
<i>The person who attacked me
was definitely the killer.</i>

363
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,630
Hey!

364
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,090
He went this way.

365
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,880
<i>Where was it that I lost him?</i>

366
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,350
Wait!

367
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,650
It can't be.

368
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,560
He attacked Lee Mi Sun
at Hyunpoong Station and failed.

369
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,680
One hour later, he killed
bus employee, Hwang Min Joo

370
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,950
in front of the supermarket.

371
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,950
And he killed the ninth two days later.

372
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,440
Most murderers would cool off for a bit

373
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,930
if they feel in danger
of being discovered.

374
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,460
It's because they fear
being caught by the police.

375
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,150
But he increase his rate
after the Hyunpoong incident.

376
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,100
With serial killer addicted to killing,
the pattern can always change.

377
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,450
He may not have been able
to control himself anymore.

378
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,070
What if he had a reason
for needing to do what he did?

379
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,540
This is where Lee Mi Sun was attacked.

380
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,770
But suddenly he was
discovered by the officer.

381
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,250
Where would he have run to?

382
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,840
He can't go towards the station because
the train station employee is there.

383
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,240
Running on the train tracks exposes him
too much, so that's not possible.

384
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
The only way left...

385
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,960
are these neighborhood streets.

386
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,070
At the end of these streets...

387
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,090
That's right.
It's Bus 95's route.

388
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,470
It's the bus stop.

389
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,700
Hey, bus. Stop!

390
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,420
Hey, you punk!

391
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,910
What are you doing?

392
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,920
The reason he wasn't caught

393
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,050
and the reason he sped
things up was that bus.

394
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,050
He wasn't choosing his
eighth, ninth, and tenth.

395
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,960
He was killing off witnesses
who had seen his face.

396
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,890
That's why he killed them quickly
before investigation could start.

397
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,390
What is this?

398
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,340
Did you meet the detective
in charge before I did?

399
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,550
There was someone who said...

400
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,810
something exactly that absurd back then.

401
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,440
- What?
- That officer who saved Lee Mi Sun.

402
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,650
He said the killer was on the bus.

403
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,690
And that's why Hwang Min Joo died.

404
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,290
It's the bus!

405
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm sure it's bus 95.

406
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,440
If you talk to the people on that bus,
you'll know who the culprit is.

407
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,720
Then you can catch him!

408
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,540
We're investigating everyone
for the Hwang Min Joo case right now.

409
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,180
Why don't we just check?

410
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,570
I was walking home on the streets
because I was done work.

411
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,110
I saw something weird on the street

412
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,070
so I took a closer look.

413
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,370
I didn't even think that
it could be Miss Hwang.

414
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,150
Yes, I was the last person
to see Min Joo alive.

415
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,840
I really don't know anything though.

416
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,510
She was on the last bus,
so she went home saying she was tired.

417
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,460
- Lee Chun Goo.
- Yes?

418
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,910
You drove the bus that Hwang Min Joo
worked on that night, right?

419
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,230
Yes, I did.

420
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,250
Did anyone get on at the Hyunpoong stop?

421
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,460
He was in a black jacket
and in his early to mid-20s.

422
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,600
You remember, right?

423
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,090
Hyunpoong stop is the very last stop.

424
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,310
- There aren't many riders.
- Right?

425
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,850
So you do remember?

426
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,590
Someone ran onto your bus, right?

427
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,050
It was yesterday,
so I remember it very clearly.

428
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,760
No one got on the bus?
Are you certain about that?

429
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,050
Yes, no one got on at that stop.

430
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,430
That can't be right.

431
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,500
I know it was him in the streets.

432
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,650
I lost him at the bus stop.

433
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,440
You're not lying, are you?

434
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,010
If you're theory is correct, wouldn't
this driver be the first one dead?

435
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,600
He would know the murderer's face
most clearly.

436
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,650
Is that correct?

437
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,930
That's what the bus driver
said back then.

438
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,270
That no one got on at that stop.

439
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,130
Is he still alive now?

440
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,160
- What?
- The bus driver.

441
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,300
Why? You think the killer
would have killed him too?

442
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,380
His health must not be great.
He's in a medical center.

443
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,760
But he's still alive and well.

444
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,110
- At the bus stop?
- Yes.

445
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,580
No one got on at Hyunpoong stop,
according to your memory?

446
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,670
That's right. No one got on.

447
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,390
It was a long time ago,
but he says he remembers it well.

448
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,690
He says no one got on at that stop.

449
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,000
What about that female co-worker
who saw Hwang Min Joo last?

450
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,970
I was supposed to see her
at her place yesterday.

451
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,300
But she must have been out.
No one was home.

452
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,320
Give me her address. We'll go.

453
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,600
Detective Cha, what are you
planning to do?

454
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,820
Do you have another lead?

455
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,560
Cold cases are all about finding
what past detectives missed.

456
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,710
We need to confirm if it's truth
or if it was fiction.

457
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,790
Let's go.

458
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,170
The roads to her place are narrow
and cars can't get in.

459
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,510
I guess you're starting to trust me.

460
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,910
I do tend to get along well
with intellectual people.

461
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,030
What a joke. Hurry up.

462
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,070
Seriously, she won't let it go.

463
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,360
I think we're almost there.

464
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,580
Why are the roads so busy?

465
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,000
Doesn't this look like the street
we drove by before?

466
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,660
Are you mad?

467
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,020
Why would I be mad?

468
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,690
Then why are you so silent?

469
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,100
What do you think he's doing now?

470
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,540
The killer.

471
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,070
He is completely addicted to killing.

472
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,570
He can't resist the temptation of it.

473
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,610
He manipulates the detectives.

474
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,390
He has never been subjected
to an investigation.

475
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,880
So, why did he stop?

476
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,400
"He is probably dead."

477
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,750
"He is probably in jail
for another crime."

478
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,890
"Or he might have immigrated
to another country."

479
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,860
People said all sorts of things.

480
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,360
But...

481
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,970
What if he's still in our midst?

482
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,790
<i>Average people wouldn't even know.</i>

483
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,390
<i>That he is a serial killer.</i>

484
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,780
Anyone here? It's the police.

485
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,600
You're entering without permission.
I don't know...

486
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,250
That... that knot.

487
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,980
It's the same as that knot from before.

488
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,800
It's him.

489
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,680
It has to be him.

490
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,280
It's a murder, isn't it?

491
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,540
Give us an answer!

492
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,460
Is the method used the same
as the Gyeonggi Nambu killer?

493
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
Has it started again after 26 years?

494
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,470
Is the killer back?

495
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,770
How far have you gotten
with the investigation?

496
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,040
Please, give us an answer.

497
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,490
<i>What happened?</i>

498
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,400
I have confirmed it yet. I'm...

499
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,900
Yes, I understand.

500
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,020
Is it true?

501
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,350
The M.O. is the same,
but we can't be sure of anything yet.

502
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,550
The cold case squad is assessing
the crime scene.

503
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,240
Once we are finished,
we will have an outline.

504
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,230
You're not sure if this is same killer
as the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders.

505
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,500
Yes.

506
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,120
Call in your team from the crime scene.

507
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,260
That case falls under
the jurisdiction of Gyeonggi.

508
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,600
Gyeonggi's Violent Crimes team
will take over.

509
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,550
Our team is investigating
the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders.

510
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,380
We have more files
and information on this case.

511
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,220
Even if we collaborate,
it won't be enough.

512
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,210
It's wrong to exclude us
from the investigation.

513
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,420
That's why you shouldn't collaborate.

514
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,340
Have there been any visitors
on the third floor?

515
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,290
No, there haven't been.

516
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,780
You must not be friendly with her.

517
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,480
Wow, how long has it been?

518
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,350
We should have a meal together sometime.

519
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,080
You're looking good these days.

520
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,200
It's the detectives from Gyeonggi.

521
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,210
They're my juniors.

522
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,580
They must be here because they're
interested in the case.

523
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,750
Well, who isn't interested
in this case, right?

524
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,060
Hey, I was so surprised.

525
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,140
Who knew that he would kill again
after 26 years.

526
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,840
He got totally scared off because
we started investigating again.

527
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,990
Who gave you guys permission
to enter the crime scene?

528
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,440
Hey, Park In Ho.
Why are you going so overboard?

529
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,580
Keep going, you guys.

530
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,520
This case is under
the jurisdiction of Gyeonggi.

531
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,610
You should all go.

532
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,830
Hey, what's wrong with you?

533
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,620
What's up with you?
What's going on here?

534
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,760
Are there hidden cameras or something?

535
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
This is pretty funny. It is.

536
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,430
Okay, all right.

537
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,450
If you need information,
I'll get you everything you need.

538
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,170
Do you think I'm like you, Senior?

539
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,500
I don't accept information or money
under the table like you do.

540
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,670
If I did and got demoted like someone
I know, that would be embarrassing.

541
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,600
Hey, it's me, Gye Chul.

542
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,570
Did you forget that you used
to wash my socks for me?

543
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,600
There's a natural order
even in shitty water.

544
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,960
A person of lower rank
shouldn't drop honorifics like that.

545
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,720
- Let's go in.
- Yes.

546
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,250
So if we're the same rank,
I can drop honorifics with you?

547
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,410
This is our case, so get lost.

548
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,170
What?

549
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,790
Are there no ethics in our line of work?

550
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,710
Why are you sticking
your spoon into my food?

551
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,720
Who are you?

552
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,860
I'm the profiler.

553
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,380
Lieutenant Park Hae Young
of Seoul Metropolitan Police.

554
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,370
The Gyeonggi Nambu case was ours,
if you think about it.

555
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,870
That's why we're suffering
like this right now.

556
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,560
Because you guys couldn't catch the guy.

557
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,350
- You bastard.
- Stay calm.

558
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:02,450
He stayed quiet for 26 years.

559
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,390
The cold case squad started
investigating and provoked him.

560
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,310
You guys are the ones
who caused this death.

561
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,030
- You think you can say that to me?
- Don't grab me!

562
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,070
- Hey, let go.
- Let go of me!

563
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,560
- You let go!
- No, you let go.

564
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,080
- Hey!
- You punk, let go!

565
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,790
You stay right there.

566
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,230
What do you think you're all doing!

567
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,860
This is a crime scene!

568
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,050
What are you all doing here?
Aren't you going to recover the evidence?

569
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,700
Cha Soo Hyun, do you think
we're enjoying this?

570
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,600
We're only here because
the higher-ups told us to come here.

571
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,200
Higher-ups, yeah right.

572
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,060
You just want to solve a big case
and move up the ranks.

573
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,890
Wow, really...

574
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,000
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

575
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,450
What a nice thing to say to me.

576
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,910
Okay, you can have the case.

577
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,420
Be careful not to overlook anything.

578
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,640
- Detective Cha, what are you saying?
- Pull out.

579
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,370
No, we can't do that!

580
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,000
Pull out!

581
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,410
Let's go inside.

582
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,020
Please leave.

583
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,090
Get going now.

584
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,180
Crap.

585
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,390
I'm going to
the National Forensics Service.

586
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,100
Take everything back to our office
and you can go home for today.

587
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,790
Are you really ending things like this?

588
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,170
Help out with the boxes.

589
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,130
That detective wasn't wrong.

590
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,410
That victim's death is on us.

591
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,390
So we have to do this.

592
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,640
What are you saying?

593
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,150
He's right.

594
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,910
She died because
we started the investigation.

595
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,050
So should we stop investigating?

596
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,840
Should we do nothing
and not catch the culprit?

597
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,900
She was killed by the culprit
and we need to catch that person.

598
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,980
But we're quitting!

599
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,950
Park Hae Young.

600
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,560
What do you do on this team?

601
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,660
You may not be quite a profiler yet.

602
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,380
But you're still a profiler.

603
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,850
While I'm the center of Seoul wrestling
with evidence and witnesses

604
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,350
you have to looking down on me from
the moon like Armstrong on Apollo 11.

605
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,430
Whether it's the evidence,
witness, or case

606
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,140
look at them from a distance.

607
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,320
You can't ever let emotions
cloud your view.

608
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,890
Don't let your emotions
get the best of you.

609
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,290
It's because of us... no...

610
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,020
She died because of me.

611
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,790
If it wasn't for that radio transmission.

612
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,090
What?

613
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,130
I'm going to turns things back to before.

614
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,520
If I still have a chance.

615
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,280
Park Hae Young!

616
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,170
<i>[Ninth, Hyunpoong street, Kim Won Kyung]</i>

617
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,680
<i>[Gyeonggi Nambu Serial Murderer
Re-emerges]</i>

618
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,230
<i>The transmissions always
arrives at 11:23 p.m.</i>

619
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:36,130
Please, you can save her.

620
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,310
You're sure you chased him
into this street?

621
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,660
Yes, it really was the bus stop.

622
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,790
But why did you go to Hyunpoong
train station at all?

623
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,290
Well, I was just patrolling.

624
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,390
I looked into it and you were off-duty.

625
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,960
Well, that's...

626
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,790
Were you in on it from the start
with the murderer?

627
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,020
What? Why? Why would I?

628
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,080
Hey, look into his alibi for
all the other murders.

629
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,120
Okay.

630
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,520
What are you doing right now?
Why would I do such a thing?

631
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,070
What are you doing? Let me go!

632
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,200
I told you it's not me.
Why would I do it?

633
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,910
We'll decide whether it's true or not.

634
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,760
Hey!

635
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,430
What are they doing?

636
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,990
Detective Lee Jae Han?

637
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,520
<i>Detective Lee Jae Han?
It's me, Park Hae Young.</i>

638
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,930
<i>Are you listening?
Detective, Lee Jae Han?</i>

639
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,120
Over here... hey.

640
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,240
The radio, the radio!
That guy did it.

641
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,840
He said that someone would die
at Hyunpoong Station.

642
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,750
Someone else has died.

643
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,300
Look, look! He said it again.

644
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,600
Hey... hey!

645
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,600
Because of me, no...

646
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,700
She died because of us.

647
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,980
If you really are in the year 1989,
please stop it from happening.

648
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,550
Look, there he goes again.

649
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,200
Excuse me, wake up. Is anyone there?

650
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,560
<i>I know you may not believe me,
but this is the year 2015.</i>

651
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,820
Listen to that guy.
He says it's 2015. He's crazy!

652
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,420
You need to catch that guy!

653
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,510
<i>We still haven't caught the killer.</i>

654
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,480
We still have one chance.

655
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,950
There is one Gyeonggi Nambu victim
who has not died yet.

656
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,580
<i>If you could catch the killer then,
the present time could change too.</i>

657
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,700
<i>The ninth victim is Kim Wong Kyung,
an office employee.</i>

658
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,060
<i>November 7, 1989 at 9:30 p.m.
On the streets of Hyunpoong-dong.</i>

659
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,910
Kim Won Kyung.

660
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,680
Office worker... Won Kyung.

661
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,230
- You're home?
- Are you going somewhere?

662
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,450
I came out to see if you were coming.

663
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

664
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,830
- I made you crab stew.
- Sounds so good.

665
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,420
I put fermented soy bean in it,
and it's so good.

666
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,160
<i>I don't know it you're
listening to me right now.</i>

667
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,180
I'm begging you, please.
Catch the killer.

668
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,070
An office employee.

669
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,990
Are you crazy?

670
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,290
Why would Won Kyung die?

671
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,010
<i>I don't know why these
radio transmissions started either.</i>

672
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,650
I don't know what else might go wrong
with this message I send you.

673
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,270
But, we can change things.

674
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:38,170
We can catch the killer and save people.

675
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,960
<i>It happened the evening of November 7
in the streets of Hyunpoong-dong.</i>

676
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,240
You punk! Where are you?

677
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,940
Where are, I said? Where!

678
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,390
Where are you? Huh?

679
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,420
Hey... why aren't you answering me?

680
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,430
Answer me! Answer me, now!

681
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,960
Answer me, you punk!

682
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,940
Wait a minute. Okay...

683
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,980
Uh, excuse me.

684
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,930
Excuse me! Hey, you!

685
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,220
Hey!

686
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,710
I need to get out! Excuse me!

687
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,280
Crap, where's the key?

688
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,030
Over here, excuse me!

689
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,540
Please, open the door!

690
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,610
Hey, let me make one phone call.

691
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,030
Don't you know who I am?

692
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,100
- You know me, right?
- What is this so early in the morning?

693
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,410
- Detective!
- He's been like this for a while.

694
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,810
Detective, let me make
just one phone call.

695
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,770
Give just one phone call. Please?

696
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,010
Who are you going to call?

697
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,620
Another body may be found today.
Kim Won Kyung.

698
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,140
She's an office employee.
I have to call her right now!

699
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,680
Are you insane?
What kind of games are you playing?

700
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,750
I really am going to go insane.

701
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,020
Let me make just one phone call!
Just one.

702
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,320
Just be quiet.

703
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,420
- Detective... Detective!
- Watch over him.

704
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,900
Then, why don't you call for me?

705
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,910
It's 8:00 p.m. already.
Why don't you just call for me?

706
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,690
<i>[Ninth - Kim Won Kyung, November 7, 1989]</i>

707
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,820
Why?

708
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,780
You said you'd turn things back?
You spent the night here?

709
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,920
What did you turn back?

710
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,610
Did you turn the white board around?

711
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,320
I can't end it like this.

712
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,820
Did anyone say it's ending?

713
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,940
- You're all here early.
- Hello.

714
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,300
The Gyeonggi district is suffering.

715
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,630
I heard they're getting a lot of
support on this.

716
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:04,390
There are barely any witnesses
and no CCTV in the area.

717
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,440
They're having some difficulties
early on in the investigation.

718
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,130
I suppose they might get a better
direction with more time.

719
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,400
Things are different now
than it was 26 years ago.

720
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,590
Investigative techniques have improved.

721
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,570
But until then,
we're in a better position.

722
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,460
It was their mistake to exclude us
from the investigation.

723
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,400
We have a lot more information than them.

724
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,530
What are you talking about?

725
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,900
You're the one who told us to pull out.

726
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,150
I told you pull out of the crime scene.

727
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,910
I never said to end our investigation
of the Gyeonggi Nambu case.

728
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,230
They have the Jung Kyung Soon
murder case.

729
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,510
Our case is...

730
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,280
the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murder case.

731
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
We just need to catch the murderer first.

732
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,760
Yeah, but we're lacking leads.

733
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,000
Don't you know that half of being
a violent crimes detective is networking.

734
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,870
So, why did you go to forensics?

735
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,070
According Doctor Oh Yoon Seo

736
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,720
this victim is different than
previous victims in the past.

737
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,090
26 years ago, victims were killed
after they were tied up.

738
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,930
This time, she was tied up
after she was killed.

739
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,900
Are you saying it's not the same killer?

740
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,870
We can't say if it is or not.

741
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,700
But I can be sure of this.

742
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:26,610
This culprit is definitely related to
the Gyeonggi Nambu case.

743
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,100
It's the knot, isn't it?

744
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:34,050
The public knew that the victims
were tied up with a unique knot.

745
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,540
Pictures of the knot were never revealed.

746
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:44,000
But the knots used in this murder
were exactly the same.

747
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,660
If we can catch this killer...

748
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,930
we will be able to find out who
the Gyeonggi Nambu killer is as well.

749
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,200
No wonder.

750
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:57,750
I thought you stood aside too easily
unlike your usual personality.

751
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,000
So I did bring some things
knowing this might happen.

752
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,460
This is a broken glass cup.

753
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,280
I got it from under the victim's body.

754
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,980
I can take it for analysis right now.

755
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,580
- Go on.
- Okay.

756
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,400
You said there were no CCTVs
in the area, right?

757
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,860
I think I know something to replace it.

758
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,560
<i>When we were driving in,
I saw a moving CCTV.</i>

759
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,990
Delivery trucks always
have black box cameras.

760
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,180
I saw three of the same stores
in the area.

761
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,950
I'm sure they delivered
around the same time.

762
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,940
They probably drove in pretty much
the same neighborhood

763
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,930
I'll use every method in the book and
get it before the Gyeonggi detectives.

764
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,580
Detective Park is dead.

765
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,460
Let's start from the beginning.

766
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,510
Start from the beginning.

767
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,650
When we arrived on scene,
the window was locked from the inside.

768
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,230
The front door lock device
wasn't tampered with either.

769
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,530
It was not a forced entry.

770
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,740
There were no signs of
a struggle by the entrance.

771
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,270
Then there's a good chance
it's someone Jung Kyung Soon knew.

772
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:36,670
The culprit did nothing for 26 years,
then killed once investigation started.

773
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,800
There's a good chance that the motive
was to destroy evidence.

774
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,750
Commit crime to destroy evidence.

775
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,180
I still have suspicions
about the bus 95 driver.

776
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,770
He knew Jung Kyung Soon and Hwang Min Joo
and is related to the case.

777
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,920
Many experts created a profile
on the Gyeonggi Nambu killer.

778
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,740
I did so as well.
The opinions do contradict.

779
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,150
But, the one thing everyone
agrees on is age.

780
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,770
A man in his early 20s who has never
had a normal social relationship.

781
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,900
At most 23 years old.

782
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,450
Also, when Choi Young Shin was arrested,
the bus driver was driving the bus.

783
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:15,750
It's hard to believe he is the culprit.

784
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,730
- What happened?
- It was very close.

785
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,380
I almost got it taken
by the Gyeonggi guys.

786
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,380
They're moving really fast.

787
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,600
Let's go. We don't have time.

788
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,860
Go to the bus company and find out more.

789
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,290
I'm going to visit
the driver and speak to him.

790
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,720
Call me immediately if you
find out anything, okay?

791
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,880
Aren't you going home?
It's 7:30 p.m. already.

792
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,360
I'm going to finish what I was doing.
You head home first.

793
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,910
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

794
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,420
What's wrong with you?

795
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,800
Ouch, my stomach hurts. Oh...

796
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,620
Are you okay?

797
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh, my stomach.

798
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,300
Get up. Get up!

799
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,810
I'm sorry. I just have no time.

800
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,840
You'll wake up soon.

801
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:10,160
Won Kyung, Won Kyung, Won Kyung!

802
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,470
Hi, is Won Kyung home?

803
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:19,360
No, she said she's working late today.

804
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,460
Working late...

805
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,010
Okay.

806
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,220
Why? Why?

807
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,880
Won Kyung, Won Kyung!

808
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,840
Won Kyung...
